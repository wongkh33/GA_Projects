Have any of you trained a two gyms concurrently? How did it work out? \\n\\nWhat are some things I can do or focus on so that my progess continues, no matter how slowly? Any ideas or suggestions are welcomed.</td>\n",

My son is in 1st grade. The teacher told me that my son choked another student who had cut in front of him in line. I told my son that he can't use BJJ on other kids when there is no imminent threat. And of course, my wife bans me from teaching my son BJJ at home. But if you were me, do you just stop teaching BJJ or are there things that I can tell him that it is for self-defense only and not when you're playing around with your classmates. I wonder taking him to the BJJ school with me may help. He is 6 years old and despite his size compared to his peers, he gets targeted for being too nice. It's weird how I'm an angry dude but he's totally different from me.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFYI: I did ask him to show me how he executed the move and it was a RNC done right. No one got hurt and the teacher broke it up real quick. I apologized to the parent of this kid but the parent apologized for his kid cutting in line. No children were harmed in this situation.   \n",

So to celebrate Kaynan's jiujitsu contributions I have a suggestion to start calling the position at 1:59 here\\n\\n[https://youtu.be/xYPsex5aeP4?t=119](https://youtu.be/xYPsex5aeP4?t=119)\\n\\nthe \"Duarte guard\". This is a video and a position which explains in a most excellent way the principle behind the basic berimbolo back take.\\n\\nI know somebody will say that people did it before him etc.. My counterargument is that it's not always about who did it first - it's also about explaining something to the community, and as far as I'm aware Kaynan was first to explain this particular principle in such a lucid way.   \n",

What about demonstrating a drill or technique and then allow the students to play with it however they feel without much correction?  I feel when I make too many corrections some students can become confused.  I don't like over coaching.  Thanks for the input.   \n",

I know the best advice is “don’t get there” but any other tips on rolling with someone with a significant weight difference?   \n",

It’s a Korean game show with 100 athletes competing for a $250K prize to see who is the best all round athlete. Some really interesting contestants including a few MMA guys, wrestling stars and BJJ black belts. The first couple of episodes have had some fun grappling style matches. Really interesting to see decent grapplers against other combat athletes (eg boxers) and military people.   \n",

I lift weights fairly regularly but would like to add some more cardio\\nTo my routine. Im 6,3 and 280 pounds so obviously struggle a bit with running, would some kind of kettlebell workout be better?   \n",

I am a BJJ blue belt who has been out of the game for several years. Looking to get back into training. Found two gyms that are literally $10 difference in price. \\n\\nOne is a pure judo gym, something I'm interested in and they train judo 6x a week. The coach is world class and literally produced many Olympians. \\n\\nThe second gym is highly regarded and has a black belt in BJJ and a black belt in judo that teach. BJJ is available 5-6x per week and the judo class is twice per week but they actually do compete in both sports. Seems like they are also highly regarded. \\n\\nI don't know if I should totally just dive into judo or also mix in some bjj. I don't think the first gym focuses on bewaza too much. They're a pure judo gym. \\n\\nMy priority? Getting in shape and self-defense. One too many encounters with people ready to fight me while walking towards the bus stop for no reason has gotten me paranoid. Plus I really miss competing. I want something to do that's not work related.   \n",

I might be switching gyms because I’m a college student and new class schedule no longer allows me to attend the this gym. Having said that, would I be considered a dick to attend a gym that matches my schedule and come back to my home gym after the semester? My coach is pretty cool and is friends with the owner of the other gym. \\n\\nTL:DR\\n\\nMoving to another gym for a better fit to my school schedule. Would it be weird to ask my coach to come back to the home gym after the semester?   \n",

This is the Force.\\n\\nAttributes, explosiveness, strain, emotion. These cannot be sustained, and destroy from the inside. This is the dark side.\\n\\nI'd love to hear your thoughts, and may the Force be with you. 🙏🏽   \n",
       "1512  You might not know this about me, but I enjoy BJJ in the off-season. Of course, the commute is pretty far, so I can't make it in that often - maybe twice a month. But I've been doing it long enough that I'm a purple belt now. It clashes with the usual attire, so I disguise myself as a middle aged dad. \\n\\n I'm better known for distributing presents on a naughty/nice basis. That goes for adults, too.\\nIf you didnt get something from me last year, it was probably something you did - but it might not be. \\n\\nThis is pretty embarrassing, but, due to supply chain issues, I'm still dealing with 2022. Normally I don't like to tell people about these things, but I'm sharing this one because I think a lot of you fellow colored belts have it in you to give the exact same gift -  it only costs a few seconds of your time, and it should help with my backlog. Let me be specific:\\n\\nThere's this white belt who comes in regularly. Odds are he doesn't post here, so I feel comfortable telling you that he's maybe not the sharpest, or the most good looking, or the most talented, or athletic, or even fortunately endowed, but he comes in and, most importantly, he is nice enough to make the cut. And that's what matters. So, to make up for the late delivery (to my own training partner, how embarrassing!) I rolled with him and gave him a convincing show of resistance before tapping, and he couldn't have been happier. \\n\\nSo give the same gift to someone in your gym. Let them finally get that tap on someone superior to them in every way. They'll ride that high for months, so long as they think they earned it. Just make sure it's convincing. Maybe let them know how much they \"tired you out\" so you \"have nothing left\" when they slap on a shoddy guillotine or Americana. And, in your heart of hearts, wish them a merry belated Christmas.   \n",

But today, during training, I was mounted and put into an Americana. I was stuck there, unable to escape, and my partner wouldn't let go. I felt hopeless, defeated, and I couldn't take it anymore. \"Just finish me,\" I cried out. \"I have nothing left.\"\\n\\nIt's not just that I'm stuck at purple belt, it's that I only train twice a month. With two kids and a full-time job, it takes a lot of work to find the time and energy to come to the gym more often. I often battle my inner demons, telling myself that I'm not good enough and that I'll never progress. But I wish I could come every day; I wish I could be there every time, I wish I could be like the others, so dedicated to their training. But life gets in the way, and sometimes I feel stuck in this never-ending cycle of disappointment and frustration. I feel like old yeller or a horse with a limp, I need to be put down to end my metaphorical suffering, but I know deep down I will continue to push through and strive for progress, one day at a time.\\n\\nI feel like he should just take my belt, absorbing all the knowledge with it.\\n\\nOSSSSSSSS   \n",

I honestly can’t tell if I’m improving because everyone else is improving with me and learning all the same stuff. In a way it’s comforting that we are progressing together but it makes me anxious cause I genuinely can’t tell if I’m trash or not.   \n",

I rolled with him today (I’m a purple belt), even 30 seconds in I felt like I was suffocating from the stench. Anyways I let him work from mount, big mistake. Because that means this smelly mfker is sitting on top of me, and unfortunately my nose is facing him. He tries to go for a shitty Americana but couldn’t finish it. I couldn’t take it any longer. Said to him “Just finish me. I have nothing left” so this smelly mthfk would get off of me. \\n\\nWe talked after the roll but I really couldn’t think of a polite way to bring up the BO issue so I let it be. But this guy smells so bad I literally can’t train with him, so I shouldn’t avoid this conversation forever.\\n\\nAny thoughts on how to approach this?   \n",

But today, during training, I was mounted and put into an Americana. I was stuck there, unable to escape, and my partner wouldn't let go. I felt hopeless, defeated, and I couldn't take it anymore. \"Just finish me,\" I cried out. \"I have nothing left.\"\\n\\nIt's not just that I'm stuck at purple belt, it's that I only train twice a month. With two kids and a full-time job, it takes a lot of work to find the time and energy to come to the gym more often. I often battle my inner demons, telling myself that I'm not good enough and that I'll never progress. But I wish I could come every day; I wish I could be there every time, I wish I could be like the others, so dedicated to their training. But life gets in the way, and sometimes I feel stuck in this never-ending cycle of disappointment and frustration. I feel like old yeller or a horse with a limp, I need to be put down to end my metaphorical suffering, but I know deep down I will continue to push through and strive for progress, one day at a time.\\n\\nI feel like he should just take my belt, absorbing all the knowledge with it. \\n\\n  \\nOSSSSSSSS   \n",

My couch is so annoying and tells me to use techniques against opponents but I overpower them easily. I have done combat sambo (the superior martial arts) and wrestling before. I tap black belts easily in the gym. \\n\\nBut he wouldn't even give me a blue belt saying I need more time. How can I prove myself to the couch? Thanks   \n",

I lock in a lazy americana to get a reaction. And while I lock it in he utters the following words in the most defeated voice ever: *\"Just finish me.

       "So this question came to me while reading up on general mountain preparedness for a variety of sports that require a good aerobic base i.e. backcountry skiing and mountaineering. A lot of the advice being given (think Uphill Athlete) is some general strength training with a big focus on general endurance training such as longer runs, weighted hikes, etc. I don't disagree with this, but don't subscribe to this myself. I actually just train like a Crossfit Athlete. Further, I tend to out perform those around me when backcountry skiing or mountaineering who mostly subscribe to the above (albeit we are all weekend warriors, not actual pros). I find I have the aerobic base to endure the long 5-10+ hour days, but have a lot more strength and muscle that I feel has made my body more resilient.\\n\\nQuestion: Any of you out there mostly do Crossfit to prepare for things like backcountry skiing and mountaineering?    1\n",

We got cleans in week one, and a heavy thruster 1RM in week two.

I did YOE for about 3 months and saw a noticeable uptick in my conditioning, but my biggest improvement was I learned more about my pacing and how to regulate energy output depending on the workout.  Absolute game changer as far as looking at a workout and knowing the range I can keep myself in without burning up. I stopped after the first phase because at the time I needed to trim back on some expenses, but I would recommend it in a heartbeat.  \n",

       "1525  Something sad happened today. \\n\\nWe have a purple belt at my gym. He is a really nice guy, around 45. He is also busy with life, has kids and comes maybe 2 times a month to train.  \\nToday we rolled. He gased after like 30 seconds. I progress to mount. I lock in a lazy americana to get a reaction. And while I lock it in he utters the following words in the most defeated voice ever: *\"Just finish me. I have nothing left\".* Tapping him felt like putting down old yeller.\\n\\nAfter the round we talk for a bit and it made me really sad how beaten down he was - physically and mentally. I tried to cheer him up a bit and it seemed to help.\\n\\nBut you know what? Fuck it! Tapped a purple, I should get his belt and absorb his knowledge - he doesnt need it anymore.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOSSSSSSSS   \n",

       "1525  Something sad happened today. \\n\\nWe have a purple belt at my gym. He is a really nice guy, around 45. He is also busy with life, has kids and comes maybe 2 times a month to train.  \\nToday we rolled. He gased after like 30 seconds. I progress to mount. I lock in a lazy americana to get a reaction. And while I lock it in he utters the following words in the most defeated voice ever: *\"Just finish me. I have nothing left\".* Tapping him felt like putting down old yeller.\\n\\nAfter the round we talk for a bit and it made me really sad how beaten down he was - physically and mentally. I tried to cheer him up a bit and it seemed to help.\\n\\nBut you know what? Fuck it! Tapped a purple, I should get his belt and absorb his knowledge - he does not need it anymore.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOSSSSSSSS   \n",

We got cleans in week one, and a heavy thruster 1RM in week two. My guess is that we are going to see something similar to 22.1 that is just a grind where the fitter you are the more it is going to hurt because you are just going to be constantly moving the entire time.   \n",

       "9   I’ll add in and back up this person’s experience. I did YOE for about 3 months and saw a noticeable uptick in my conditioning, but my biggest improvement was I learned more about my pacing and how to regulate energy output depending on the workout.  Absolute game changer as far as looking at a workout and knowing the range I can keep myself in without burning up. I stopped after the first phase because at the time I needed to trim back on some expenses, but I would recommend it in a heartbeat.   \n",

We got cleans in week one, and a heavy thruster 1RM in week two. My guess is that we are going to see something similar to 22.1 that is just a grind where the fitter you are the more it is going to hurt because you are just going to be constantly moving the entire time.   \n",

       "9   I will add in and back up this person’s experience. I did YOE for about 3 months and saw a noticeable uptick in my conditioning, but my biggest improvement was I learned more about my pacing and how to regulate energy output depending on the workout.  Absolute game changer as far as looking at a workout and knowing the range I can keep myself in without burning up. I stopped after the first phase because at the time I needed to trim back on some expenses, but I would recommend it in a heartbeat.   \n",

On my home screen in the app I can see where I submitted my score and it shows what I got but I cannot expand anything. I can go to my “profile” or whatever it is called but it only shows me 2022 and before that, to where I can expand and see my percentile for each of those.   \n",
