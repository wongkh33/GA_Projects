14,"The main thesis of my post/question is basically in the title, but for some extra context:

Started BJJ in late 2021, and have been training as often as I can since then even though I've had a couple months-long breaks from BJJ training in that timespan since I started. I had a 4-month break from training at the start of 2022, and another 6-month break from mid 2022 to early 2023, both times mainly stemming from the fact that I am in medical school. And for as much as I love BJJ, my academics had to take precedence when it came to deciding what I poured my energy into.

At the start of 2023, I've been able to return to training on a regular basis (I try to go at least twice a week). Right now, I'm still in the process of shaking off the rust from the 6-month hiatus I took, but I'm definitely in the mindset of wanting to both catch-up with the people I started with (some of whom have competed multiple times, and have earned a couple stripes in the time I was gone) as well as make good on my goal of competing that fell by the wayside in 2022.

And there's a competition coming up in a couple month that I'm interested in joining, but looking at my schedule, I know I don't have the time nor energy to prepare for it in an optimal way, or in a way that I would personally feel comfortable going into a competition in. At best I could start going to training 3x/week, and/or changing my current off-mat workouts to more conditioning type of routines but I know I can't prepare for it in a way that I think would make me feel confident about facing off against other grapplers. On one hand I know that even if I lose, that would be a valuable learning experience but at the same time I don't like the idea of losing when I know I could have done a better job preparing or risking letting my teachers down. Or perhaps, I'm overthinking this? Haha either way I'd love to get some insight on this",subs,bjj

19,"Quick review if anyone is interested:

I trained at all 3 gyms using the one week pass. Mostly no-gi and wrestling. The one week pass was pretty easy to set up and very affordable for a week of unlimited sessions. 

The gyms are all very clean and hygienic. There was free shower gel available in the showers and signs about ringworm / skin infections up on the walls. Also a log via a QR code was on the walls for if a skin infection did occur...refreshing to see a school take a proactive approach to reducing these things.

The instructors were very friendly and, despite me just dropping in to random classes, they made sure I was welcomed. Lots of wrestle ups. Ollie in Collingwood showed a sweet wrestle up into a body lock position from butterfly guard. The wrestling class with Connor taught some slick/tricky techniques using redirections which was also very good. At every class I went to the instructors made sure to come round to every pair while drilling to check/improve their technique. These guys have definitely thought about how they are teaching and it shows in the quality of the sessions I went to. 

At the end of each roll in the Collingwood, a couple of minutes was given with your partner to discuss things you felt / things which happened during the roll. This was pretty sweet, led to some cool discussions with my partners, and meant that I picked up some good techniques / concepts from my training partners. 

Open mat at St Kilda was absolutely rammed and sweaty. I have never been leg locked so many times in my life. People there were cool - hard but technical rolls!

I'm suffering my second back injury in just the 3 short years I've been practicing jiu jitsu. The first time around it took me out for the better part of a year (~ 9 months). Lots of rest and PT, and I made what felt like a full recovery. Waited until the new year rolled around and got back into it then, only to get 7-8 classes deep and reinjure myself. Same exact injury I had, just not quite as severe this time. The injury itself isn't quite sciatica, but very similar symptoms. 

The reason I'm writing is that I'm afraid I'm going to have to stop training. It sucks to say it, and I've been feeling pretty down about it these past few days to be honest. There aren't any other hobbies that I'm dying to take up that don't cost an arm and a leg. Would getting into boxing once this heals again be a bad idea? Sure, there's more head trauma than bjj, but I think it'd be a little easier on my back. Let me know if you think it's a bad idea or if anyone else has gone through a similar situation. Thanks in advance!

TLDR; I've dealt with the same back injury twice now due to jiu jitsu. Should I start boxing or look for a whole new hobby outside of martial arts?",subs,bjj

Guy is all tense and heavy breathing, mullet and tattoos, he reps out the armbar drill with the same kind of movement and energy a person might if they were doing deadlifts. When I do my reps he’s all tight, he doesn’t let me move his arms to practice the technique. But he’s also not a dick; asks lots of questions and clearly makes an effort to relax when I ask him to. Just nervous and typical first class stuff. When we roll he’s fine - too passive to even roll so we just spend the round practicing regaining guard.

Still, I worry what might happen when he’s paired with another newbie of similar spaz potential.

For example, I have been rolling with this guy for a while who is a few years younger than me. (I'm 26 and I believe he is 21 or 22) He used to wrestle in high school and has picked up on jiu jitsu fast. He usually smashes me, but I have tapped him a couple times. He seems to like me and everything, but just recently after we were done rolling, I asked him after how to do a certain takedown, and it was like he did not want to show me. He told me, ""I need to work on my hand and footwork first"", and then he finally did show me a takedown in a not so helpful way and proceeded to act like he was beating my face in. He was like, ""if this was a fight, I'd just 'bang, bang, bang' to your face"". I just felt awkward and felt like he was trying to intimidate me and act like an ""alpha"".

Another dude I have rolled with, kept kind of laughing or in an arrogant way told me not to do something in bottom side control. I just told him that I was trying to frame to shrimp out and escape.

I really have enjoyed BJJ and do not want to quit, but I do not like this kind of bad sportsmanship and condescending behavior. I have been nice to everyone I rolled with. Whether I lose to someone or I beat someone, I treat them the same way with respect.

Dear [r/bjj](https://www.reddit.com/r/bjj). 

Long time reader, first time writer. I've recently watched our lord and savior - Don Janaher's: ""Half guard passing and dynamic pins"". Good stuff, but he seems to skip how to get to the head when passing, the so called: ""Cranial shift"".

Whenever I try to to apply the techniques in sparring (on blue belts and up mind you), people just block the arm that’s going for the crossface, and I must weave in between their arms to set up a reverse crossface grabbing the belt, which to be fair, is shown how to do in the instructional.

That's all fine and dandy, but I would like to create an opportunity  where I can apply some of the other 99% of the techniques shown in the instructional. I've obviously tried searching online myself before posting here in the hopes of not looking like a complete jackass, but I can't seem to find anyone addressing this issue.

My instructor is a half guard maniac, so most people that I train with have a fairly solid bottom game, and a tough knee shield to pass too, so I tend to just go for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFjAGP0LkNc) move when facing the pesky knee shield. So for the sake of clarification, my question refers to a chest-to-chest situation.

First, if you left on a good note. Like say, you left cause you moved country or state. 

Second, if you left in a bad way.

I'm right handed and when sparring in boxing I have orthodox stance (left foot in front). However, I've been getting more and more into guard passing last month. I do all of my passes to the left side. Mainly I use knee cut, side smash, X pass and toreado.

I watched some videos and really liked over under pass explained by Bernardo Faria. However he passes to his right side.

Then it hit me. If I pass to my left with the knee cut, shouldn't the right foot be in front and not the left foot? Or does it even matter?

Should I learn to have my right foot forward in BJJ if I prefer passing to my left or keep it as it is and learn over under pass to my right to have options?

Then he just gets up and goes to the advanced section of the class (despite the coach saying it was for 4 stripes and above) without saying a word to me. So I’m standing on the mat like an idiot without a partner.

Later we rolled and he tapped me very quickly, a lot faster than many blue belts.

I looked it up and I can't find it anywhere. He also told me to play caterpillar guard (which i found a video online of) and oyster guard (maybe he meant octopus guard).

However, majority of the people in my gym are around the same height or much taller being 200 lbs to even 300 lbs. Even with other white belts, I feel like the few times I get a good setup, I get muscled out. I understand that there is so much I have to learn with techniques, but I cannot help but feel overpowered in some situations. I have been using framing a lot recently, but my forearms or legs end up being crushed against my body and my defense has been limited to being able to slip out because of being so skinny.

 I just recently got my elbow popped by a much larger blue belt while I was trying to perform a technique, with my instructor watching telling my opponent to use more technique. It is really disheartened me because I felt like in that position I got just muscled. Its discouraging because I really want to focus on my technique and escape, and when I roll with my size or 20-30 lbs heavier people , I feel I have more freedom to focus more on what I am doing rather then without having to worry about being muscled into a rice ball.

218,"A bit of a background, I’ve been training for the last 6ish years as a purple belt. My training consistency has suffered a bit over the past few years due to being a masters athlete as well as life commitments. 

Something I’ve noticed every time I return back to training is that most schools follow the same linear structure. For example, the same move/ system is drilled for a few weeks with variations every week added to the concept. It might be attacks from mount for 8 weeks, but every week is a small variation on the attack/ concept every week. 

What I’m slowly starting to realize is that most of my time training is spent sparring with lower belts on with basic concepts. We do a ton of positional sparring from the concept taught that day. I don’t feel that my game is expanding because the same curriculum is being used on repeat every year. I’m a bit old school and have a bunch of instructional books and videos. I find that I’m learning more by studying film and then having a group show up to open mat to go over the concepts and drill.

I guess what I’m asking is at what point do you feel that the professor/ academy you currently train at is just teaching the same thing month after month. Once the basics are solid, at what point is it more on you to learn and just have the professor as a guiding resource to help troubleshoot rather than to teach new moves or concepts. Im having trouble with showing up to class just to drill the same basic concepts on lower belts every session. I have no resistance since the lower belts don’t even have a grasp of how to defend any attacks. Do higher belts reach a point where the professor is no longer teaching new things and it is up to the athlete to shape their game?

254,"If you're practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), I want to share with you some major mistakes that I've learned to avoid. Here they are, in a concise list:

1. Neglecting fundamentals: I've learned not to skip learning the basics, like proper posture, movement, and positioning. Without a solid foundation, it's difficult to execute advanced techniques.
2. Being too tense: I've learned not to be too tense or use too much force when executing techniques. This can make me slower and less efficient, and can also lead to injury.
3. Not tapping: I've learned not to be afraid to tap when caught in a submission. Ignoring the pain or pressure can lead to injury and a longer recovery time.
4. Only focusing on winning: I've learned not to only focus on winning. Instead, I focus on learning and improving my technique. Winning comes naturally as I progress.
5. Not training with different partners: I've learned not to train with only one or two partners. Training with different partners exposes me to different styles and techniques and helps me improve faster.

Avoiding these major mistakes in BJJ will make your training safer, more effective, and more enjoyable. Remember to focus on the fundamentals, stay relaxed, tap when necessary, prioritize learning over winning, and train with a variety of partners.",subs,bjj

But notice that when he's going against a resisting opponent (he tells his uke to try not to get swept) you see him pushing around the knee with an open hand [(26:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6MItk9heAk&amp;t=26m20s). 

Now there may be valid reasons to switch from grabbing at the ankle to pushing at the knee during a live roll, and these details might've been too complex to go over in the scope of this video. 

Another possibility is that the idealized version of the sweep that he has in his mind, or that he was originally taught, is not the same as what he now uses and he's not fully aware of the small adjustments he's made to the technique.

Whatever the reason is, we should be aware that the instructor will often have minor or major differences between what he teaches and what he does.

Don’t know much about BJJ technically speaking, but i can pick up stuff pretty fast if someone gives me the right pointers and i also have some background in judo.
Last Monday i had my first lesson, coach literally told EVERYBODY in the room i was a newbie and that everyone that would roll with me had to be careful, respectful and just either play it slow or defend guard so that i could get the hang of it.
I’m super fine with that, it is what it is, i’m here to learn, i got no fragile ego, no macho man shit, nothing at all.
This guy comes up and he offers to roll with me. 
“You the new one right?”
“Yup”
“Ok, we’ll keep it easy, i am on rehab for knee surgery, let’s roll”
Good lord.
He proceeds to literally OBLITERATE me: i got ragdolled, sit on, neck cranked, rear naked choked and whatever the fuck he pleased without a single word.
No “try defending this way” or “put your legs that way”, just a full-on tactical rape.
He didn’t slow it down even when the coach got a bit concerned and told him to “remember to go easy”.
Now, as i said, i have no issues recognizing my level is below zero, but was this really necessary? 
Was this good for me? 
Was this supposed to teach me something?
Is this shit common practice in BJJ?
I am still motivated and optimistic about my journey, and sure i will avoid rolling with this mf again since the experience hasn’t left me anything valuable to work on, but jesus christ what a start.

Let me explain what happened:

Yesterday I was on my way home from training, when I watched three guys harassing an older woman. Two were cutting her off and one guy tried to rob her purse. She was holding on to it with all her strength and screaming for help.

I wasnt thinking twice about it and although it wasnt very smart, I ran right towards this altercation in order to help. Its all a bit blurry but I remember that I jumped in with a flying teep. I landed at least two very hard elbows, clinched and fired off some of my hardest knees. My lowkicks are really hard and it only took a few until the whole exchange went to the ground. i somehow managed to lock in a nasty triangle choke to end the whole fucking situation! My adrenaline was pumping like crazy and I only took minor damage, a few scratches, nothing bad.

280,"So I've recently got back into the sport after 5 years off.

Going in to a new gym and seeing the environment there was the complete opposite of my old gym from years ago.

I thought I would share some horror stories of my previous gym and yes...these are all real which everyone at my new gym can't believe they did.

1) If you never wanted to compete you would never progress in belt.

2) If you couldn't attend the grading day every 4 months, you would never progress in belt.

3) If you joined as a coloured belt and got beat 3 times in 1 day by lower belts you got demoted to the belt below.

4) If you asked regarding your belt/stripe you got held back by 2 years (I made this mistake being a naïve teenager at the time).

5) The Instructors word was final, no arguing, if you didn't like it you leave, end of.

6) If you wasn't a \*favourite\* of his you would rarely get help on technique.

7) If you wanted to stay after class unless you were a \*favourite\* he would charge you extra.

This was a gym I went to 4-5 days a week as a teenager. Was a White Belt for the 3 years I trained there (I never competed and stupidly asked about stripes/belt).

Now I'm back after all these years off and have the free time to train, I am extremely grateful for the new gym environment and the ability to train in the sport I love.

\*PS - The old gym which I will leave unnamed with the same Instructor is still running. It also has retained it's bad reputation and has an incredibly high turnover. Unsure whether the dystopian rules still apply however I won't be returning to find out.\*

\*Small Note\* - I couldn't care less about belt colour now I'm older, just grateful to be back rolling. Makes you appreciate it significantly more when you're not chasing a dyed piece of cotton. Plus having everyone in my current gym getting annoyed with my White Belt, calling me a sandbagger is quite amusing. They all say I should be higher, I always reply, if it happens it happens, when you spend this long away from something you love due to work commitments things such as belt colour become irrelevant.",subs,bjj

For example, today, we were drilling X-guard sweeps/takedowns, and doing some situation sparring from X-guard. I attempted a sort of wrestle at one point but kinda stopped half way through and conceded. My coach instantly said “if you’re going to start wrestling, you need to commit”. 

Another time, I was just rolling with someone and we were standing up. A few times I attempted takedowns and grabbed his leg but then just let go. He instantly said “that was good, you grabbed my heel, but you should have committed, you just let go instead”. 

So I’m noticing that I have a tendency to not commit to a move, and convince myself instantly that I’ll fail the move or otherwise not execute it well in this instance, so it’s better to avoid doing it. I think that’s my thinking anyway.

Ive told my best friend who we started training together that I would take any purple belt on the planet at his similar weight and bet them every time. He is literally the worst purple belt on the planet. Less than 1 year from blue to purple?! Unacceptable to me.

392,"Sorry for the clickbaity [HELP] at the end but here's my question:

I'm an oldish guy (around 40) got some injuries, and want ro start BJJ. I did grapple with friends before and did a tinu bit of judo, wrestling and even BJJ but it was very short and like a lifetime before this one. Literally before I got married and got all those kids running around the house. Yes I'm old. 

Now it happens that because career change I've got time to indulge into a hobby and after thinking a lot about a martial art to practice I think I'm chosing BJJ. I can go 3 to 4 times a week I think.

Only problem I have is there are two schools around me, same distance, one is hyper competitive (they had black, brown and purple belts winning medals in the European championship last month, their insta is full of that) and they're know as one of the best schools in the country. They train 7 days a week and even have days with two training sessions. Also not only there are black belts everywhere but I was talking to a friend that practices BJJ and knows them and he told me that a purple belt there is almost like an experienced brown belt elsewhere. 

The second is a bit more chill and is only two days a week. The instructor is legit, has lineage and won nationals some years ago. He also fought some supermatches in the USA last year. But there's maybe 2 black belts outside of the instructor and most of the others are beginners with a few color belts here and there.

I went to both, both are friendly and welcoming. The first is more like a tight close family of real determined guys. The second is like a group of friends that are learning a combat sport.

I really want to get good at BJJ but I'll admit that I'm a bit scared to get injured in the first one because of the intensity they roll with. It's like a non stopping championship there. Not a dig at them because they were very nice when I went to see their session. 

As an old guy what should I do ? Man up and go for the first one ? Or realize that I'm old and not winning any championship and settle for the second ?

Today a purple belt came to our fundamentals class and I got a roll in with him. Will try to describe the first 10 seconds which left me amazed. I started sitting and got a de la riva. When I pushed with my outside foot he slipped back and I felt like I pushed against nothing. Then he bent his other leg out of my ankle grip and took a couple high steps over my legs (while I was trying to grab anything with my legs and hands) and got to a knee on belly position. I then tried to shrimp away but he took a backstep (?) around my head and got to a side control position on the other side of me so he had my back. 

The rest of the round was just him destroying me, but that first couple seconds of that round stuck with me. Even though we were so close together it felt like I didn’t even touch him before he got my back. So fluid and slick. I told him afterwards how amazing that was and he just laughed it off but I was seriously awestruck by his movements. Jiu Jitsu is amazing. Why do I suck so much haha.

I'm always trying to balance being a coach, and working on the things I need to work on to improve. Trust me, there's room for improvement. One of those areas is my submission game. I think I took the position before submission advice too far, and my submission game, both in setting them up and finishing mechanics, has really lagged. I also tend to be a bit of a softie, and let people work if it's clear that I'm the superior grappler. I don't really have that kill mode. I've been told by several mentors that I need to submit the lower belts that I roll with, and so I've started to do so. I'm not ripping stuff, but when I roll with new white belts, I feel like a dick subbing them several times in a roll.

402,"I think there's an interesting discussion to be had regarding how hard you should roll with someone who you're able to beat by mainly using size and strength. On one hand we all want realism, but on the other hand people are not going to progress very fast if you never let them practice anything except curling up in a ball and trying not to die.  


I have a couple thoughts on the subject, would be interested in hearing reactions and alternative points of view.  
1. There's an important distinction between whether your first priority is to develop yourself or to develop your partner. If you're a white belt, you should probably almost always focus on developing yourself. Putting your own oxygen mask on first, so to speak. In this case I would argue that you should use rounds with small people to practice your offense, progression mainly happening in the form of using less and less of your energy to win (rather than using full power to blast through 20 submissions in a 5 or 6 minute round). But you should be winning. Don't worry much about whether they're getting better, that's their job. Just don't injure them and you're good.  


2. If you claim that your primary goal is to develop the other person, I personally subscribe to a philosophy that says ""train to win, not to lose"". The meaning behind that mnemonic phrase is that the resistance level should always be calibrated so that the person you're trying to coach is successful more often than they are unsuccessful. I've seen suggestions like 80% success and 20% failure being optimal. I don't know that there's a right answer, but certainly if your protege is succeeding 100% of the time, that seems too easy. So pick out the most egregious mistakes and punish those, but let smaller errors and weaknesses slide for now.",subs,bjj

My friend quit after a few months because he got his first girlfriend and wanted to spend more time with her. I thought about quitting because it was really hard but my coach said I should stay because I am the only 115 pounder. 

At practice this week this jiu-jitsu guy came in. He looked really really old like maybe 30? Coach put me with him first and I've never had anybody beat me up so bad on the mat. He was super strong. Then he wrestled everyone on the team and pinned them all. No one could even score a point on him until the biggest guy on our team took him down for a second. The jiu-jitsu guy did a thing with his legs and the heavyweight just fell over. He said it was called butterfly guard? 

I talked to him after practice and he said he wasn't even that good but that he had medaled at master worlds. He said jiu-jitsu was tougher than wrestling because they have extra moves like kimuras and heel hooks and strangles (is that better than a choke or something?) 

Then our coach made us do cardio and the jiu-jitsu guy smoked us all at that too. He took his shirt off after and he was so ripped. A bunch of guys asked him what supplements he was taking and he just laughed and said acai. Later I heard someone whisper about TRT (isn't that for like old people?) and a little bomba (What?). 

I told coach I wanted to quit wrestling and do jiu-jitsu but he said I should keep wrestling because jiu-jitsu won't get you a scholarship.

What if the next time you decide to buy a gi, because of this purchase, another person in an impoverished community receives a brand new gi and belt to train at their social project? Is this something you would be interested in? If yes, this is an excellent opportunity to ""pay it forward"" for what jiu-jitsu has done for you.

In conjunction with Braus Fight &amp; Braus Foundation, the 501 c3 nonprofit Organization Jiu-Jitsu Tribe (JJT) proudly announces its Jiu-Jitsu Tribe GI made by Braus. Purchase one gi and produce another Gi for a child. 

Gustavo Dantas, 6th degree-black belt, have lived in the USA for the last twenty-four years, half his life, and he co-founded the organization in 2010. He travel and visits social projects around the world, meets tribes and their leaders, and witnesses the impact of jiu-jitsu in their communities to share with the supporters and donors stories of how jiu-jitsu can change lives in many ways. 

Dantas shared: ""JJT Mission is to inspire, impact, and improve the lives of at-risk children and young adults in impoverished communities worldwide utilizing jiu-jitsu as a personal development tool for kids &amp; young adults in partnership with Mental Health related organizations and local Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu academies. We also support social projects that offer free jiu-jitsu classes to their communities. We do so by providing facility improvements with construction, new equipment like new mats and uniforms, and, most importantly, guaranteeing the sustainability of the programs by offering a monthly salary.""

Would you agree the world would be better if more people trained jiu-jitsu? Most likely, if you train jiu-jitsu, your answer is Yes. However, not everyone has access or funds to pay for a gi and the monthly dues. That is when 
incredible leaders teach jiu-jitsu for free, and JJT tries its best to inspire, impact, and improve their projects in some way.

By providing access to training and resources, these social projects can help address the issue of limited access and funds and provide a positive outlet for those in need. Jiu-jitsu is more than just a sport; it can also help build confidence, discipline, and resilience, which are valuable life skills that can have a lasting impact.

461,"Since Gordon’s blasting of NR ive been having a hard time understanding why the majority of people here think Nicky Rods body is unobtainable naturally. Just because you can’t doesn’t mean it’s not possible. (Expecting the downvotes) 

Now I understand the motive to do steroids when everyone else in the sport is, and that in itself is enough for me to believe he’s most likely on the sauce. However, the photos and his body changes from his teenage years until now don’t scream steroid use at all to me. 

He claims from 17-26 he gained 50 lbs. Most men with decent genetics can expect to gain about 30-50lbs of additional muscle in their lifetime if training. Now that’s about 5,5 lbs a year which is well within the natural range. In addition he’s probably now reached his genetic limits after almost a decade of lifting. 

His physique at 17 was already excellent and this is usually a good indicator of one’s genetic potential. Compare this to Gordon Ryan from 17 to now and you will see the change is much more drastic. 

Finally, in the photos posted on Gordon Ryan’s instagram many of them are of NR clearly on a pump with good lighting and at good angles. Camera angles and lighting can drastically change your appearance. Looking at NR physique in his Adcc match with Gordon (when he should be at physical peak) you can see he looks small compared to photos in the gym posing with good lighting and a pump. 

His genetics are good don’t get me wrong but in my opinion nothing crazy and definitely obtainable for someone who’s not built like shit and has the frame/genetics for it. This is not to say I’m sure he’s Natural, only a well thought out random testing regiment could prove that. I’m also not saying everyone can look like him, most people do not have the potential to. However just like height varies between individuals so does the ability to build muscle and there is nothing about his body that someone with the genetics for it couldn’t achieve.",subs,bjj

472,"Hi all,

I've been training Jiu Jitsu for 2-3 years now. I'm dedicating a good amount of time each week to rolling, I keep physically fit, have a one hour private lesson once per week and watch instructional series.

My questions are, as an amateur competitor, what advice do you have on optimising the trajectory for progression in the sport? And what mistakes did you make in your learning process that others can learn from and what would you differently?

Personally, I wish I had utilised video footage of my rolls earlier as it seems to be the most accurate way to gain feedback. Also, I would have focussed more on pin escapes from an early stage.

Keen to know your thoughts",subs,bjj
473,"Now for the record I am a white belt with only a few months of training. My professor is a monster who is a multi stripe black belt (I’m too scared of looking stupid to ask him what exactly his rank is, that is a me issue not a gym or professor issue) but he told us at the end of class to remember. If we think we have something down and perfected, we don’t. 

I know that may sound demoralizing to a lot of people but I think it’s good advice to keep peoples ego in check. He explained it that BJJ techniques can spiderweb into a million different variants. You can always tighten up your technique or find ways to turn it into something new. To me that’s part of the constant struggle but also the beauty of this sport, it’s truly never ending. So to those who feel like you’re not getting any better or feel like you’re at a loss or can’t improve more. There’s always something you can do to improve your BJJ and keep evolving it",subs,bjj
477,"Hey, so I have a competition coming up in about 5 weeks, and wanted some advice to ramp up the intensity and all that during rolls. Especially the amount of effort I put in rolls.    


I am a white belt, that only does no-gi, with a decent amount of prior wrestling experience(wrestled for over 10 years, but that was over a decade ago). At first I was having some serious issues with my cardio so I started to really dial back the ""effort"" I was doing during rolls. By this I mean I slowed myself down in how I moved, stopped exploding as much(now maybe 1,2 and at most 3 explosive 10-15 second bursts in a 5min roll), and focused on defensive movement, securing positions, and waited until/and attempting to use physical pressure to make an opening presents itself.   


A lot of the moves I go for atm are based around body locks, and holding my partner down as I slowly attempt to work on passes, getting into dominant positions, etc. But don't get me wrong, I am actively trying to work on the new moves/series we are going for in practice(when applicable), especially the sweeps.   


The problem I'm having though is I feel like I'm really only putting in around 50% effort in a given roll. Not really trying hard, or even taking opportunities(unless they are clean/easy to take). I kinda think my issues with cardio are still in the back of my head(which I am really working on, outside of the mats).   


I know with this ""style""/effort with rolling I'm doing I can really easily get through 5, 5min rolls without being dead tired, get in some ""dominant"" positions, and even threaten/hit submissions every now and then on more experienced guys(upper-level white belts, and low-level/new blue belts).   


But I think in the competition this style might not be successful. Don't get me wrong, in the stand up I know I can make takedowns happen if I need to. When we hit the ground, I just think that ever opponent will be a lot more explosive and dynamic, making my current ""game"" and how I approach rolling uselessly.   


how would you guys suggest I ramp up my effort in practice, or is what I'm doing a valid thing to do?",subs,bjj

482,"So . I'm an avid half guard passer- I just love the systematic controlled approach and have perfected it very well in no gi.

I usually use the overback grip to set it up but when I try in the gi I cant usually get past the collar frame- in no gi I would hand fight ala Gordons Overback grip series, but its tough to break that collar grip at times.

Does anyone have a go to when adopting the same philosophy in the gi- i.e how to get past the knee shield and get to that chest to chest half guard before working to upper body grips?

P.S- When you are chest to chest- crossface and underhook. Opponent posts on my leg to stop me using the outside leg as a pry to get to mount. 

What's the thought process here- headblock covert to double underhooks then mount? Im so used to people posting on the hip that it kinda threw me off at training last night.",subs,bjj
484,"So just like the title said there is this head bitch, a guy to be clear that has this click of assholes who walk around acting like they are the shit, they are all blue belts by the way, what I see is a narcissist person who is extremely manipulative and has the power to influence these other people to be like this, they are actually nice when he is not around, they are all pain no gain, competitive mindset, which would be ok if he didn't have this asshole attitude, now the crazy part of all of this is that everyone else knows he is an asshole and constantly talk about it behind his back, they talk about how self centered he is, how he acts like he is the shit and only a blue belt, about  how he berates people for losing a match but when he loses one well is just life you gotta keep learning and training.

Even the owner constanly talks about, so my question is this, how can someone be such an asshole and you know he is an asshole and yet when he is around you are all so lovely with him, telling him you admire his determination and focus like wtf.

It feels like in highschool being bullied by the popular kids and nobody is doing anything to stop this, I'm really trying to get this to not affect me",subs,bjj

I’ve been doing martial arts, mainly bjj since I was little. For as long as I can remember now I have had pretty large stretch marks on my arms, chest, lat muscles and shoulder. Some on the legs too. I’ve never been overweight or anything. 

Just curious to see how many people have them. I have a twin brother who trains aswell, though I’ve always trained more especially in terms of general fitness alongside bjj.",subs,bjj
494,"I was taught a takedown in the gi, but seem to figure out the name for it. I will try to explain: 
1. Start with crosscollar and sleeve
2. Pull your opponent in so he becomes square and heavy. 
3. Get his head under your armpit: Front headlock-ish but with loopchoke Grip. 
4. Get your own head down.
5. Kickout your own leg on the same side of collar and sleeve Grip to roll through and take your opponent down.",subs,bjj

Its a clutch at straws but if we could air the guy out publically I think that would be the coolest, can we get this guy bombed with terrible reviews pls? 

While we're on the subject I may as well mentioned why I was banned from the gym. It's because I went to the best gym in the chicago area in terms of fighting/skill/resources. He said he knows everything I do and has people that will report my movement, this was very disturbing and creepy. he sounded like an ex.

As for why I ~~think~~ know he's a fake black belt is the first time I visited the better gym, my purple belt striking class teacher said he found it curious how my coach wouldn't give up the name of his professor. And that if the professor was truly as bad to him as he said, he wasn't going to stay there long enough to get the black belt. 

And for the stuff he taught us, it was all dogshit, Kimura's from guard, and armbars from mount, we were fluent in zero other techniques in bjj.",subs,bjj
498,"Interesting recent video from Chris Paines at BJJ Globetrotters camp (jump to around the 45 minute mark)

https://youtu.be/qX30Wx5glJg

Chris makes a good point (using left handed half guard player student) why you might want to play differently  on the left vs right / play differently against opposite side. The gives the analogy of control hand and gesturing hand.

Anyway, I thought it was interesting. Usually people may aspire to being equally good on both sides with a move, instead of having different, equally good moves for left vs right, so it's a different way of thinking about things.",subs,bjj
500,"Hypothetically say you're 18 and a competitive blue belt, you want to win worlds and ADCC. You've won the lotto 2 billion and have unlimited funds.

What's your plan?",subs,bjj
505,"Hi,

I am working to improve my half guard bottom game (generally using John Danaher's Go Further Faster instructional series) and I've found I am way too vulnerable to being submitted by chokes (mainly d'arce chokes).

I would appreciate any pointers anyone has as to how be less vulnerable to this.

To provide some context, I have been training Jiu Jitsu for  2-3 years and train both gi and no-gi. I like to get to tight waist position and then (depending on my training partner's reactions) go for roll through sweeps or double leg takedowns.

When going for the roll through sweep from tight waist, when I take a scoop grip on my partner's inside leg, how do I prevent being cross faced?

Much appreciated",subs,bjj
506,"Hi, 

I have my 2nd ever comp in 2 months time as white belt 95-100kg. I’m a pretty casual bjjer but obviously would like to do my best and hopefully win. Been training 1.5 years if that’s relevant!

What things outside of bjj can I work on to help give me a good edge, which I can improve in 2 months. I can only train bjj 2-3 times a week just with schedules and family stuff so can’t really up my bjj training too much.

I was thinking more along the lines of strength (body weight or lifting), fitness, flexibility/mobility and what could I actually see most impact from in this time period. And maybe some ideas about how I should improve this? I.e should I do some lifting 2x a week or follow some yoga videos etc? 

I’d say I’m average in most of the above for my weight class but not brilliant I.e can bench my body weight for a couple reps, can run 5k. But I’m currently not doing anything outside of bjj in terms of other fitness but do have an underused gym membership I can make use of.

509," Do any of you stretch while your coach is teaching technique? Obviously in a way that still allows you to watch and listen to your coach. Do you think this is disrespectful or distracting to other students? I find it hard to get myself to warm up and then stretch or do mobility work when I'm at home, and there's a big chunk of time where we're already warmed up and just sitting there while the coach demonstrates technique. Those 15 minutes every class could really add up, but I never see anyone doing it.",subs,bjj

I talked with him and he said I’m not prepared and it doesn’t make any sense to compete. Yes, maybe he‘s right, maybe I’m not well prepared for gold and he does this because I take the losses very hard. But that doesn’t make give up competing. After every loss I get more and more motivated to start train more and learn more.
Should I tell him that I want to compete even though he thinks I’m not prepared or should I just wait till he says I’m prepared for it?

515,"Question...anyone here actively doing  BJJ after a lumbar fusion? My surgeon called with a date this week which I put off because I want a new MRI plus have  developing family illness situation. I damaged my L4/L5/S1 lamding on a military parachute jump gone bad in 1999 and currently have a 24% assigned disability from the VA (Canada).I have tried hard to get healthier , including losing more than 100 lbs starting four years ago pre BJJ. To be honest I am pretty active despite moderate pain levels and BJJ has been an excellent way to help maintain my weight and keep my back mobile.

516,"I have trained bjj since late 2018 (august) and I was around 11 back then and I would only go 2 per week or if I was lucky 3 times a week because they were the only kids class available, I am now 15 and go to adults classes and roll/wrestle with adults. There are no other teenagers there so it’s just me and a bunch of adults. However I get very fed up and pissed off as every-time I wrestle a adult they are usually stronger than me so when I’m on the ground they will just pull my frames out and get cheap Kimuras, this gets me fed up because I feel hopeless at jiu jitsu as I have been training it for a while and I always lose on the ground to adults who haven’t even been training for a year and you feel like absolute shit. The only thing I can do to adults that I will agree on that I’m quite good at is takedowns, I will always get double under hooks on any white belt even 4 stripes and I will get very good takedowns it’s just once it hits the ground I can never submit or defend against submissions and it pisses me right off and sometimes makes me want to quit jiu jitsu because if I’m being honest it’s a really bad kick in the ego when you lose to someone who hasn’t even trained a year (sorry for being childish about this)

And just to put it out there I didn’t really go to jiu jitsu that much last year as I was focusing on playing rugby, but other than that I have now decided in the last few weeks to train about 3-5 times a week (2-3 hours per session) because I did go overseas on holidays and wanted to start the year doing some good jiu jitsu.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/2lveat/im\_done/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/2lveat/im_done/)

Purple belt here, over 10 years of training and probably more athletic than 95% of humanity.

And still, there are 2 stripe white belts whom do crazy Matrix entries and get my back/foot and tap me.

Yes they might be better than the average white belt but still, I have 0 clue how they pick up things so quickly. Of course I have no idea what their unfair advantages are (maybe they had someone whom learned them how to learn and they focused on concepts instead of techniques) but even after training for such a long time I can't seem to get over the fact that there must be a secret sauce somewhere. I also tap some brown belts but they are average, so it's not that I totally suck lol.

And yes I'm totally aware that a blue belt whom wins the worlds can beat many average black belts, but seeing newbies whom just turned 18 get so good so quickly, really brushes my ego. Especially when they say that the only thing they do besides regular gym is watching some Langaker videos and Leandro Lo for passing.

Is it the Duning Kruger effect? Is it the fact that I started in a time where I had to unlearn many bad habits/ Beats me. Anyone can relate? Some very good athletes here whom are self aware enough how they do it?

Luckily I have my purple belt and can finally stop BJJ whenever I want lol.",subs,bjj
521,"1. SIGNING UP Usually talk to your coach about this first. Make sure you choose the correct division and also weight class – and you don’t need to go all-out cutting at this point (this is not the UFC). Smaller tournaments with fewer sign-ups will often combine weights and even belts (in no-gi) but never gender (for now!!?) in order for there to be a true bracket; this happens shortly before or on competition day (and you can always advocate for yourself beforehand as well!). Sign up as early as possible (for the cheaper rate and to encourage others to “take the leap”), and you can always ask for a refund or credit to their next tournament (or report to your credit card, if absolutely needed). Even one opponent is a good experience – and in these cases ask for round-robin (best 2 out of 3) instead of sudden elimination. Email the organizer for any questions but don’t assume they’ll get back to you either; messaging on social media  (Instagram!) may even help, or ask your coach to do so on your behalf.

2. WEIGH INS Read about the process: Okay you already know no jewelry or long nails but is it the night before (usually super/cage fights), or the morning of and you have the rest of the day before your fight to eat, or right before (like IBJJF and you might have to starve until your fights). If you are close on weight you can often try the scales beforehand (early in the morning) and go to the sauna or not consume too much (and beware about water fasting, water loading and laxatives!). On that note, what will you bring to eat and drink?

3. CONSISTENCY Don’t do anything too different – this goes for food, drinks (I mean okay if you usually drink alcohol and smoke and do drugs, maybe don't), techniques, warm-up, stretching etc. (So, don’t go for a flying triangle you saw online the day before, or take that new supplement that’s going to give you the runs.)

4. PACKING &amp; PREPAREDNESS  Pack the night before. Bring everything you can think of from phone &amp; charger, headphones (I heard playing calm music is actually better!), food/snacks, water (like more than 6 oz.), electrolytes, an extra (no)gi, socks, comfy clothes to rest in (a low key pillow) etc etc. Cash may be required for entry for anyone supporting you who is not competing (they usually pay outside the door while you can tell them you are a competitor and they’ll direct you accordingly.

5. PUNCTUALITY Get there on time/early and know you’re usually going to be super early (so don’t bother getting annoyed as schedules for small tournaments are usually off). 

6. ATTENTIVENESS Stay close/ listen for your name to be called especially when it’s getting close; check (refresh your browser!) the online schedule (if you miss in IBJJF you’re out while other tourneys are more forgiving).

7. FOCUS &amp; SPORTSMANSHIP  In rare cases (in white belt level), their coach /teammates may be obnoxious; shake their hand afterward anyway – especially if that is the case (kill em with kindness!) as well as the refs (okay unless it is really bad and they throw chairs, for example).

8. COACHING You may have a coach going in, but you may not hear a word they say or they might even be busy coaching a teammate going at the same time. Simply having someone to support you (merely sitting there / watching/ in the same building) is something to be grateful for. Now, even if you are super tight and in sync in training, competition day is another animal. Talk to them about their style and ask them what to expect, as everyone is different (and that doesn’t mean they are wrong): personally, I would ask them to tell you the time left, the points, and how they will coach offensively and defensively (for example, positive language might be better than “they’re going to take your back, don't let them take your back, don’t let them take your back” or the level of details or lack thereof “Triangle! Triangle! Triangle!” when you are nowhere near one or so you think. 

9. LEGAL TECHNIQUES  Vary depending on each organization (which sometimes even changes over time) AND the division you are in; in some cases like with few competitors and a very mixed division, you can talk this out and decide amongst your opponents and the organizer. 

9. RULES Know them: The ref can suddenly end the match – basically give a DQ – for many reasons including if they think you are in a compromised position where you could get hurt (if you are overly flexible you might want to give them a heads up before the match to prevent some unfortunate situation like this). Furthermore, in IBJJF, a ref can give an advantage at the end of the match when all is said and done causing your down opponent to now be in a tie with you and then win the match by decision.

10. BIASED REFS &amp; DECISIONS: Whether or not they will ever admit it (whether or not they even know they are doing it), even if they are Brazilian (and/or know the team/coach of your opponent) and this is common knowledge in IBJJF, don’t let it get to this. End on top at least, and be aggressive at the end (without being too risky). You cannot change points/the outcome, even if they’re blatantly wrong (especially in IBJJF, except in rare black belt cases). You can always ask the ref what happened (even in IBJJF they often respond even if it is more serious and not exactly encouraged).

12. TIMING You can ask for more time before your next match (IBJJF is hardest but definitely possible) if the schedule ended up working out weirdly or, for example, if the matches before you were all quick subs.

13. MEDALS Go to the medal table after the entire bracket is over and take a podium picture with your opponents or go home empty-handed. Smile and be happy that you put yourself out there.

14. Know you’re going to always go back to the drawing board. Losses are often better learning experiences than wins, but there’s also nothing like digging deep for the W. 

15. Don’t underestimate what’s in your head &amp; heart (regardless, one day, hopefully, you realize there's much more to it than technique and strength).",subs,bjj

""BJJ vs Taekwondo: Why BJJ is the Superior Martial Art

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to choosing a martial art, there are a lot of options out there. However, if you're serious about learning effective self-defense, then there's no question that Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is the way to go. While Taekwondo may have its strengths, it simply cannot compare to the practical and real-world applications of BJJ.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, let's talk about the physicality of the two martial arts. Taekwondo is primarily focused on striking, which is all well and good if you're looking to get in some cardio and work up a sweat. But when it comes down to a real fight or self-defense situation, striking can only take you so far. On the other hand, BJJ emphasizes grappling and ground fighting, which has been proven time and time again to be the most effective form of self-defense. By learning BJJ, you'll be able to take an attacker to the ground and use various submission holds and locks to neutralize their threat.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, let's talk about the mental benefits of BJJ. Unlike Taekwondo, which is often taught in a rigid and formal manner, BJJ is all about practical application and problem-solving. You'll be constantly challenged to think on your feet and adapt to new situations, which can be incredibly rewarding both mentally and physically.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, let's not forget about the sense of community that comes with practicing BJJ. Unlike the competitive and sometimes cutthroat atmosphere of Taekwondo, BJJ is all about supporting and learning from one another. Our gym fosters a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone can come to learn and grow as martial artists.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, while Taekwondo may have its strengths, it simply cannot compare to the practicality, mental benefits, and sense of community that comes with practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. If you're serious about learning effective self-defense and growing as a person, then our BJJ gym is the place to be.""",subs,bjj
540,"I see lots of parallels between jiu jitsu and masturbation. 

A first observation is the number of times you work it per day. Casuals like me are limited to once or sometimes even twice per day if they’re lucky, but the experts somehow manage three or more - how do they do this? Are they not physically (and mentally) drained? What’s more, you always get the feeling that they’re supplementing their hobby by watching video after video until it blends into their actual life and they can’t tell what’s real or fake.  

Surely people are overworking it? Experts do it so much that their equipment becomes frayed, torn, and loose - it feels like their stuff could rip at any moment. They’re so worn down they need to apply ointments and tape themselves up every time they want to play. 

On the topic of videos, some casuals will contentedly watch the short vids for free, not so invested that they need a subscription or membership. Experts will happily pay hundreds per month just for one scene with their favourite actor/actress. 

Whether casual or not, it feels like so many young men nowadays are getting addicted. And yes, it is an addiction: There’s something about the mind body connection that seems almost spiritual and it’s pulling more and more in every day. It’s sad, it changes how you look at life, the way you communicate with other people, and it can ruin your relationship with women.

Some of the instructors at my school say I roll more like a blue belt than a white belt with no stripes but our head coach has yet to even promote me to a 1 stripe. I also do very well against other white belts my size and can hold my own against blue belts my size. The question I have is how do I tell my actual skill level? Is it a bad thing I haven't got my first stripe yet? Am I actually as good at jiu-jitsu as the instructors are saying?

550,"In college we used to have a club sport BJJ (no gi) taught by a purple/brown belt. I stuck with that freshman year until I graduated. I am a young mid 20s woman now looking to get back into BJJ. The gym most accessible to me is gi only, so I am very unfamiliar with that. 

I would really love to roll again. However, that is locked behind 10 beginner classes at this gym. They say it would take not quite a month to get through these, but that assumes you attend all 3x/week they offer beginner classes. Only 1x/week I can attend due to scheduling conflicts so I am looking at nearly 3 months before I would get to roll. 

I understand why they would want beginner classes, as you don't want unsafe behavior or just bad partners. Some other gyms I have visited before have let me roll on day 1 so this was a surprise to me. It is a bit frustrating. The beginner classes are significantly shorter than the normal ones and I don't feel like I'm getting a good workout when I leave. I asked and no accomodations could be made. 

I am thinking of either doing drop-in classes at another place less convenient or just leaving in general and going the extra distance elsewhere.",subs,bjj

* Cross collar choke - even when I've got my head down, weight on the correct side of their body, I'm still getting rolled over everytime I reach for the opposite side collar to choke. 
* Armbar - I find leaning back to finish the armbar to create too much space - almost every time, they're able to get their shoulder off the ground. I'm trying to do the variation where I put my shin across their face and finish belly down but feel like I'm being a jerk everytime I try. 
* Americana - same problem as the cross collar choke. Getting rolled over on whichever side I no longer have base.
* Triangle/head arm - I don't usually go for either option as finishing means giving up mount.

Just wanted to get this off my chest. It's been five (I think) years since I was promoted to purple belt, but also four years since I've been off the mats. 

  
 As a kid and young adult, I was a huge fatso. Talking 178 cm and 110 kg's. A friend got me into bjj. Took me a few years to get the hang of it but started doing everything: eating healthy, lifting weights. On top of that I became a bjj nerd. Watching videos, mindmapping the classes, checking r/bjj daily,... I had (actually still have, he still texts me) a good friendship with our coach (he just started his academy and for a while I was one of his only competitors). 

  
Down to 80kg's and a sixpack and I was happy on the mats.   
Then life happened. Had my first kid born and life was hard. My gf was recovering badly, the kid was a lot of work,...  

  
I just stopped going to class. Gave up lifting weights, slowly dropping every sport I did. Second kid came and it didn't help.   

  
I'm a fatso again but have just went through the attic to find my bjj stuff and can't wait to puke during warmups tonight. If they still do stuff like that.

I got a lot of good suggestions. Checkmat was the one that was suggested the most. I’ve also had to some people reach out to me and I wanna say I’m really grateful for all the support.  

Some people raised the question why I need to go with an affiliation at all. I talked to two of my old professors that I trained with while studying in China.  R said to go with either checkmat because they’re a big team in the area or ask my other old professor, A (a friend of both of ours and the guy who graduated me from white through purple). A offered to promote me when he felt I was ready. 

What option should I go with? There’s pros and cons for each situation. 

Affiliation: 
+ good for marketing
+appears more legit to be promoted by a big name
-costs a lot of money annually
-strict affiliation rules and potentially culty or greedy business practices
-the promoting instructor doesn’t have a relationship with me
- I’m buying my belt because I won’t have a close relationship with the promoting instructor 
- potentially having to wait for a couple of years to get promoted to prove my loyalty to the affiliation 


Small instructor:
+ I have a guy who actually cares about me and I’m not just a bank account
+ I don’t have to worry about potentially cult like structures or greedy business practices 
- costs a lot of money to fly my professor in
- might look like I bought my belt because I had to fly my professor in or fly to Brazil for it

He replied he would take one of them down, get to their back, and threaten to break persons neck if the other assailants don’t stop. Do you think this would work but with a rear naked choke instead? Would their be legal consequences if you were getting jumped by 3 people or is it considered reasonable force at that point?

I mean it feels great to have my hard work and dedication recognized, and my game has gotten a lot better, I just don’t think 5 months is an “appropriate” amount of time to get promoted. Don’t get me wrong, I trust my instructors judgment and an absolutely thrilled to have a blue belt, but I even told my coach that I don’t feel like I deserved it. He just said “nonsense, I feel like you’re ready and you’ve earned your blue belt”. But I always thought it would take *at least* a year to get promoted to blue belt.

At the standard rate for a top level competitor's seminar in our area (approximately $100) our gym would be pretty packed to offset the cost.   Would you be willing to pay a little extra for a less  crowded seminar?  Or would you prefer to save a few bucks and be tight on space?  If your favorite competitor was to do a seminar that would be limited to say, 25-30 people, would that be worth a premium to you vs a seminar by the same guy but with 100 people there?

652," Been training BJJ for just over a year, and never had any issues until a few months ago. I train a couple times a week, just for fun, enjoy learning something new and love that post sparing feeling.

Basically recently if we're drilling any kind of choke I usually start feeling like i want to vomit, almost like a gag reflex. It can last like 15 seconds too, so even when i'm switching to try execute the choke i still feel in.

For the most part i've managed to be pretty subtle about it, but honestly started to not look forward to training because of this. I've had to ask a few people to go not put the choke on properly during drills if it's especially bad, this isn't ideal for the training partner at all.

For extra context i'm not eating or drinking near training, I eat a light lunch at maybe 1pm ish, and don't train until 6:30pm.

Has anyone experienced this and got any tips to overcome? I've seen a few similar posts but it seems like the sick feeling was due to exertion. We always do the drilling before sparing so i can't blame it on exertion.",subs,bjj

I’ve been rolling for about 3/4 months now and love it, but I’m a little older (32M) with years of sports injuries. Starting BJJ has already Re-aggravated some discs, and I’m self aware enough to acknowledge that I’m somewhat spazzy and actually hurt my own knee trying to do an arm bar from mount. 

Anyway, I haven’t been able to really go to any classes and roll full speed, and when I do go I put on the Gi and just go like 10-25% to learn the move we are learning that week. All the other white belts know my story and are really accommodating. When it comes time to do situational training and really go full speed, I just bow out and my partner rotates with another pair. Very nice of them and the professors are cool with it too (one of the black belts even told me to just where the Gi and go light).

Anyway, my physical therapist has made it clear that at this point I have to take like 3-4 weeks off and let me knee sprain heal, but I don’t want it to look like I’m not going to class anymore or fall behind. I’ve done this once before in December when I hurt my back, but today I went and stayed in my street clothes and sat on a bench alongside the mat and watched a class. Is this weird? Like, 

A) does it look like I’m being dramatic/ that kid who shows up to middle school with the colored paper bracelet still on so people ask about my vacation  

B) does it look like I’m brown nosing and sucking up 

C) is it just kind of weird to have someone from your gym not train but sit and watch without changing clothes or participating at all",subs,bjj
674,"**What is The Shoulder Crunch Sumi Gaeshi Sweep?**

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/qw76rrqhwkga1.gif

Popularized by Gordon Ryan.

* Common pre-moves: Butterfly Guard, Open guard.
* Common post-move: Mount, Top-Passing Position

**Technique Breakdown**

* Just like last week's technique, the Shoulder Crunch is one of those techniques where the setup is probably the most important and most complicated part to execute.
* Since there are many ways to set it up, I'm going to show you one and then give you the prerequisites that are needed to get the sweep. You can set it up in any way you feel works for you as long as you fulfill the prerequisites.
* **The Prerequisites are:**
   * Your opponent's arm needs to be extended and above your head. Hand on the mat is preferred.
   * Your head needs to be on the side of your opponent's head and not directly under it.
* Now that you know what you need to get in order to be able to do the technique, I'm going to break down one of the most common setups:

&amp;#x200B;

**Part One - Setup: Failed/Fake armdrag**

https://preview.redd.it/t7qvpvytwkga1.png?width=1181&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c1017187f1a5f0b90f67ccab82a1ae2730d4865e

From butterfly guard, you're going to set up an armdrag, and instead of dragging the arm towards your opposite side (Red arrow) like you'd do in a regular armdrag. You're going to drag their arm towards the same side (Green arrow)

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/o2tp26oxwkga1.gif

&amp;#x200B;

As I said. The goal is to get their arm extended and above our head.

Your opponent will try to posture and retrieve their arm, so it's not extended.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/96xgdad1xkga1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c669ba7496bd44800e88207002f2b1ec676a23d6

In order to put their hand on the floor and above your head, pull your knee to your chest

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wylu7dg2xkga1.png?width=1349&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8e561841fd64aa1083b7e8d33edde25be17ed6db

That's it. Prerequisites are met now!

&amp;#x200B;

**Part Two - Shoulder Crunch:**

With their hand extended. Lace your arm through and make sure you're elbow deep, and don't leave any empty space between your elbow and your head.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2mh0yn15xkga1.png?width=972&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d06bdd339aeea416b0d77300816caf653c14c08e

The key is ensuring their head is next to yours and not over yours.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qxfmn8x5xkga1.png?width=453&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dc7cb80622d58074ac1a313a3c7d1b8e21f157aa

&amp;#x200B;

Lock your hands together.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part Three - Sumi Gaeshi:**

Generate a push-back reaction by lifting to the opposite side of where you want to sweep them

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y4r2fw29xkga1.png?width=943&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=79aceb3692b4ade49fa75dc0c404e8702901fa89

When they push back, use your inside arm and your butterfly hooks to lift their head and body to the side you want to sweep them.

It is important to keep your elbow high so they cannot post the trapped arm on the mat as they roll over and get swept.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Training Plan for the Week**

I train 3-4 days per week (I drill at home with a dummy almost daily). In order to make it easier for you and everyone else to adapt this plan to their training schedule, I'll divide the week into two parts and an extra for the lucky ones who can train more than 3-4 times per week.

**First Half of the Week (Training sessions 1 &amp; 2 of 4 for me):**

* This technique is all about learning different ways to set it up, from butterfly/open guard and even half guard.
* The actual execution is fairly easy, but I would spend the initial part of the week drilling the actual sweeping technique before focusing on getting the shoulder crunch position from the butterfly guard. You don't want to get the shoulder and be unable to finish, which is the easy part because you didn't drill it.
* Next, focus on rolling playfully with smaller opponents that are way below your skill level. Pull guard and get into butterfly guard, testing the baits and trying to do a good replicable setup. Don't just try to get to a shoulder from a scrambly position. Be deliberate and try to create setups that are repeatable.
* Remember, the first half of the week is meant to get reps and some feedback on the things that you are doing wrong and how to fix them.

**Second Half of the Week (Training sessions 3 &amp; 4 of 4 for me):**

* Gradually start picking better and better opponents until you cannot perform the move anymore. Once this happens, start going down and picking less skilled opponents until you get to a sweet spot where you are performing the move more than 50% of the time you try it.
* Try to finish your week performing the move as flawlessly as possible with someone, no matter how low their skill level is: You want to make the last rep as perfect as possible. That's the repetition we internalize the most when we leave the training room.

That’s it!

741,"A ""friend"" of mine opened a school which was supposed to be his mine and a few others who aren’t in the picture anymore (1 got into it with him after a heated roll and the other main guy is too busy at work). It was going fine and all for the past year. 
So the Last time I showed up I showed up a little late (10 min) and I mentioned another guy still in his car (didn’t try to snitch) was just wondering if it was him. He got upset. When other guy came in he was telling us shit and I told him my situation why I was late. He told me something along the lines of yeah because you ain’t shit (different language and not a literal translation but that’s what he meant). Then I said well you know I live further away from the gym than he does(he lives 5 min away) and then it got personal basically he said I don’t do shit for my family. It was awkward but I stayed and we had class. Oh and another thing he said was ""I don’t need your money"". funny thing is next day was the 1st. He tried to be cool with me after by offering me food. I didnt accept I said I was going home to shower. I told him the next day that I had things to take care of so I couldn’t pay the fee. He said ""see you next month"". Now I get that he wants us to be the best gym and he would like everyone on time and to be fair I do show up late most days no later than 10 minutes tho (ever). But I don’t think he handled it well, also not to brag but I’m the best grappler in the gym. Even better than him tho I attribute that to my youth over him and my athleticism and he’s taught me a lot of what he knows on top of knowing his game already. I’ve honestly felt like moving to the biggest gym even before this gym was opened but I felt obligated to be a part of the team and I grew into liking it. We even have a high level black belt come in at times to train us (he’s from the other gym). I don’t like confrontation so I just let it go but I feel like he’ll think I betrayed him by moving as he thinks we are cool still but I hold that grudge still. I feel like a disservice to my partners who are all white belts when I give them the best rolls. Another thing is that this school is the only no-gi school in my area and I don’t want to do gi but they do no gi 1 day out of the week (excluding open mat). I’m lost about it. Obviously training isn’t cheap so I can’t pay for both on top of that I felt disrespected and not appreciated though I understand it was heated in the moment. I really want to move away to train at the hub of Bjj in my state (bteam or 10p) which is over 4 hours away but I’m not financially capable of doing so yet plus I have my kid here but I’m 28 not getting younger and I’ve done this too long to just give up. I don’t know what to do anymore. At this point in my life I want to compete at the highest levels I can possibly reach but I feel my backs against the wall.

Been working my back attacks again after a bit of a hiatus focussing on mount and realised that I do not have a good system for digging to get the chin and its costing me the sub at times.

2. A rolling wrist method from Gordon to get under.

I knew I had to flatten him and break his grip to get the Omoplata, because he could not hop over or roll out because I had his belt grabbed and hip blocked. I am fairly small (160lb/5'9"") and he is fairly bigger than I (230lb/6'2"") so using my free hand to break his grip was pointless.

Last night I was rolling with a more experienced guy who is definitely better than me and managed to lock the arm and get the tap.

I own two Gold brand gis. The pants on the A3H are too tight, such that I can’t reeeeally roll in them. They restrict my movement too much. The pants on the A4 are so loose as to be unusable. When cinched and tied there is just a huge bunched up fabric situation. The A3H kimono is too small around and the sleeves are just slightly too long. The A4 kimono is slightly bigger around than ideal and the sleeves are about four to five inches too long. 

I have also my gym’s gi by a brand called Breakpoint, in an A4. This is the one I wear most. The pants are tight but okay. They only slightly restrict my movement in certain positions. The kimono is slightly too small around and the sleeves are about 2-3” too long.

The pants on all three are too long by 2-5” depending.

I am in the gym about 3 days a week as is, so having more than one gi is very convenient. 

Any suggestions? The size charts are virtually useless in my experience, as they are usually in pounds, which means nothing. Any brand offering a size chart in centimeters or inches yet?

I find that far too often especially during drills I understand what the coach is saying I understand what is being told to me but for some reason I keep getting jammed up because I overthink like thinking about every stupid little minuscule detail every movement possible and while in some ways especially going slow it's great, when we are actually doing things as a drill full pace especially when I got someone talking to my ear trying to talk me through it I just find myself jammed up like I can see what I want to do I can think about what I want to do but everything gets screwed up

Rolling and sparring I do pretty decent and I can see myself getting significantly better, and for whatever reason I don't have this problem when we are rolling or sparring in striking classes, it's literally when we are drilling that this happens to me

Not sure if anyone else has had this issue and can relate and I'm hoping that if someone has they have some advice because obviously you can't just stop thinking but there's got to be something that I'm just perpetually missing you know?

I was told however that I would not receive a promotion if I didn't go to white belt sessions but whenever I go I am facing people that don't know techniques very well so end up cranking me and going 100% which is the complete opposite of open mat and mixed level which emphasises flow and technique over raw power.

 so I had the choke fully on elbow under chin and all, because I have long skinny arms I always have to hand walk up my shoulder to close the choke except he was pulling my arms down with all his might, I did'nt lose any ground but I couldn't get my hand up any further and could'nt quite close the choke enough to get the tap.

Is there much I can do in this scenario where someone is that much stronger than me do I just need to bulk up? I've been told to crunch down and pull my shoulders back when applying the choke but that did'nt do it this time.

815,"As you probably guessed, this is going to be a weird post. Hold on tight.  I'll try to make this complicated story as quick as possible.

Some quick background on me:  I'm a Canadian in his mid-30s now living in Rio de Janeiro.  I trained religiously at a pretty good MMA gym from the time I was about 16-20 and competed in/won many tournaments back in the day (although I know the sport has grown a lot since then!). At that time, my gym followed the Judo belt-color system, rather than the BJJ colors (presumably because our head instructor's background was in Judo and Kickboxing) - and after 3-4 years of training I achieved level of green belt. But I burned out, life caught up to me, and now I have only been on the mats a handful of times in the past 15 years, but I've maintained some athleticism for an old guy.  Furthermore, I haven't been back to my 'home gym' in a long time.

Back in the day, before the whole IBJJF circuit and system - tournament divisions were based on weight (ofcourse) and years of experience -- such as 0-1 years, 1-3 years, 3-5 etc. (perhaps NAGA still uses this?).  But with the growth of IBJJF and new tournament formats (divisions based on white, blue, purple belt,etc.), my old gym has since switched to the traditional BJJ belt system so that our fighters can compete.  From what I gather, my instructor was essentially given an 'honorary' blackbelt from Renzo in recognition of all his accomplishments, as our fighters have fought in some of the biggest organizations around the world.

This brings us to today:  I'm looking to ease back into training consistently.  Although I lack fitness, I do feel like I'm around a blue belt level.  I've dropped into a couple of gyms in Rio wearing a whitebelt and I get some weird reactions from my classmates - mostly people find it funny and call me a fake whitebelt, but a couple of the other blue belts have acted a bit bewildered.  My portuguese is decent, but not good enough to tell this story.

I suspect that if I dropped into my old gym after all these years, I MIGHT essentially be able to 'swap' belts (and it would be great to see my mentor again), but I live half way around the world now.  My old instructor is in my facebook contacts, but we haven't spoke or caught up in ~5 years and I would be horribly embarrassed to make this request to have him promote me over zoom or whatever (in this post-corona world of 2023).

The bottom line is, I want a blue belt.  And I see my options as follows:
1) keep wearing the white belt and work hard in hopes of some sort of 'accelerated' promotion here in Rio
2) be a huge phony and buy a blue belt; hope that nobody ever calls me out (I think I'm worthy, and I think it would make for a funny story someday, but the idea makes me feel a little dishonest and sick)
3) contact my old instructor and see what he thinks (I dread this idea for some reason)

As with any other complicated situation -- sometimes organizing and writing my thoughts out like this helps me to make a life decision, and I'm now starting to lean towards option #1.  But #2-3 have been creeping in the back of my mind these past few weeks.

Im extremely near sighted, -10 in both eyes, and have trained Muay Thai/Boxing/BJJ for the past 10+ years.  Recently my eye doctors have been strongly warning me about the risk of retinal detachment. Several members of my family have had it happen with various results post surgery. 

It seems that any blow to the eye can cause it.  Considering I’ve had my fair share of eye pokes and have also had my orbital broken from catching a heel in the eye from an attempted armbar, it has me reconsidering training.

I’m 35 and just doing it for fun at this point. I enjoy the sport, but not enough to risk losing vision or the usual complications after retinal reattachment surgery (cataracts, glaucoma later in life).  

Not asking for medical advice, just want to see if anyone else was in the same position and what they did.",subs,bjj

836,"Here’s the challenge that I’m dealing with

I’m currently training at a gym, I like the community I have great training partners and all. 

But I have competed several times and I felt like my training there will never get me to where I want to go, I’m not going to be Mikey but I’m thinking I can be good enough to challenge the lower tiers practitioner at tournaments. 

As I don’t want to burn any bridges 

Can I train at two gyms simultaneously? New gym where I get the most important training get ready for tournaments and stuff, and current gym to still have the camaraderie.

837,"The use of performance-enhancing drugs in competitive BJJ has been a controversial topic for decades. 

However, with the rise of social media and personal branding, attitudes towards this issue are evolving. From BJJ athletes publicly claiming to be natty (Nicky Rod, Ruotolos, Lachlan, Meregali) to legends being caught using PEDs (Royce, Pena, Braulio, Paulo Miyao, Leo Nogueira), the conversation is becoming more prevalent.

The lack of testing for performance-enhancing drugs in events like the ADCC makes it easier for athletes to use them and talk about them without any major (sport-related) consequences. 

It would be cool to see a gym (or a group of people) take the lead and have the courage to address this issue head-on. 

The incentives for talking openly and honestly about PEDs in the sport of grappling are increasing. Sponsors might even like that kind of openness - at least it would produce a lot of visibility and clicks.

The past 2 weeks that i couldnt train resulted in me not being in my best mental state (nothing serious just feelt worse about myself)  as showing up to training does make me  feel more confident about myself.

841,"I just had my first introductory class at my local academy  (I am in Australia) and it was fascinating, I attended the beginner class with white belts and a few blue and purple belts helping out. I did Judo and Muay Thai from 10-14 as well as Olympic lifting at 16. Since I'm entering university I wanted to pick up a sport that would help me become more confident and fit (gyms aren't my favourite). I discovered BJJ. However, when I attended the class they were all very nice but seemed so much more advanced, I felt very out of place and almost like a child (the youngest attending would have probably been a 19 year old, and there were only 2 other women there, one was a purple belt assisting). I guess what I am asking is if anyone has any advice on how to feel more comfortable and a bit more confident (I felt very nervous about applying actual pressure and overall felt like Bambi on ice with the different techniques. I almost feel like there would be no one I could properly spar with). I felt awkward with my body and the way I had to place my legs. I guess part of me wants to commit and get the gi and membership (which might I add is $200 so it's a big commitment plus weekly fees) and progress and overcome the feeling of being a child and inferiority. But then there is this part of me that thinks that perhaps if I were to find somewhere else perhaps I'd feel better (however there aren't many academies/dojos near me). Or perhaps I should just drop the idea of doing BJJ and try and join a sport at my university (I did archery for a decade however I wasn't particularly good at any specific sports, I shopped around a lot as a kid and with my parent's jobs, I was never really able to commit to a sport for too long.

But when we got up he told me aggressively that you can’t fight fingers, and obviously I knew that already and I have never done it and I’ve never tried to do it(intentionally).

So I then asked him respectfully if I did that because I was a little confused. He said yes and I said ”I’m sorry it was not my intention to do that” and he didn’t say anything.

well, something much simpler, after reading some of the recent posts about dvd reviews. I wondered, let's have chatGpt write the review. So I took Danaher's Standing2Ground: Takedowns &amp; Standing, Volume 1 and extract all audio to mp3. I then ran it through a transcriber to get all the text of the audio. I then fed that text to chatGpt. It takes around 10K characters as max input, so i had to slice the 50K character transcription into 5 different requests to summarise. I then took that resulting 4K of text and asked it again to summarise into key points, and it returned:  


* *Upper body takedowns have advantages in Jujitsu over lower body takedowns.*
   * *Providing upper body control first, making it easier to score and reducing risks of submissions and getting caught under opponent's weight.*
   * *Combination of upper and lower body takedowns is ideal.*
* *The problem with leg tackles is they don't prevent upper body rotation, making it easy for the opponent to get up.*
* *Starting with the upper body has advantages over starting with the legs for a successful takedown.*
* *To perform the techniques, minimum athletic requirements must be met.*
   * *Ability to reach the mat with hands, balance on one leg, lock up and step inside opponent's legs, and make a smooth transition from legs to upper body.*
* *Grip development is important in grappling through techniques like pomeling and hip checking.*
   * *Pomelain focuses on upper body positioning, primarily on the head and shoulders.*
   * *Hip checking involves blocking opponent's hips to prevent a take down and counterattack.*
   * *Understanding the relationship between the shoulders and hips is key to success.*
* *Practice in a semi-live setting is important to develop grappling skills.*

&amp;#x200B;

I have not watched the dvd vol1 myself yet, so dont know how good/bad the results is, and the above was very manual, but I think there's enough in all this, for us to consider and think how we could leverage the bots in future and in the Now. They wont replace us, but I think those (not bjj necessarily) who know how to use them the best, will be able to create exciting new paths forward. 

If i ran a gym I would start wearing a microphone to record all my teaching audio. One use case; this could be auto-summarised into a daily post on the gym's internal comms, for members to have as a lesson summary. (hmm, maybe i should offer such a service...)",subs,bjj

857,"Hi everyone!

My question is about the benefits of using a BJJ dummy and whether it’s worth purchasing one for home use. 

I’m in the position where I only have the time and flexibility to go to training 1-2 times a week. I always watch matches and YouTube breakdowns daily as BJJ/NoGi and MMA are the only sports I watch. 

The reason for considering a dummy outside of time restraints is that I was off due to an injury, which lead to a significant amount of time off due to having axial spondyloarthritis which got quite bad when I was immobilised, I’ve worked hard in physio, stretching, yoga, running and now I’ve been back training BJJ for a few months… but in that time I’ve found that I’m really struggling to lift myself up in certain positions whilst on my back, so I really need to find a way to get the drill reps in, which is difficult considering how infrequently I can get to training.

So, I’d really like a dummy so that in the evenings once my son has gone to bed I can practice my drills, and whilst watching YouTube breakdowns, I’ve always found that having the ability to physically try out the move helps me learn it better, and my gf is definitely not a fan when I get her to drill with me 😂

What do you guys/gals think? I’ve heard a lot of people say they used one for a week and then never used it again…. But as I’d use incorporate it into my physiotherapy I feel like it *might* be beneficial? 

Also I’d you have any dummy recommendations or alternative to learn drills from home etc that would be amazing :)

880,"Now I’ll try my best to describe it, please bear with me 

It’s similar to a body lock pass, but instead of locking hands around the back, you go under both legs with your arms and cup/grab gi trousers on the opposite leg of the hand you are grabbing with (eg right hand cups the left thigh) 

Once you establish this grip, you ensure your chest is over your opponent’s knee’s and sprawl hard, pin your head onto one side of the hip and kind of throw your opponent legs to one side to get the pass. 

This explanation may be completely and utterly wrong, but if you think you may know the name, let me know. I would love to study it a bit before an upcoming competition, I’ve had some success with it in training, but I would love to dive deeper into it.

I can't break the sleeve grip, I feel like I have no balance all the time, and even if by some miracle I break the dela riva hook I get swept to my left side immediately which I cannot defend because I can't use my left arm to support myself.

901,"I am a 3 stripe white belt. About 1 year and 4 months of training. 

When I spar, I'm generally doing well with positions. My survival on bottom is good (relative to a white belt). I can make it tough for guys up to purple belt to submit me. I will get multiple sweeps every session, usually a scissor or hip bump sweep. I am decent at passing guard and getting side/mount (again, relative to a white belt). 

The issue I'm having is I'm not submitting people much. I do get submissions occasionally. Usually on people who are physically weaker, smaller, or a lot less experienced than me. I do get the occasional submission on equally or more experienced people, but it's rare. 

I have two problems. First, I think I'm too nice. Sometimes I see a submission that I could rip on someone but I'm afraid of hurting them. When I try and apply it with control it usually gives them too much time to escape. I find it nearly impossible to submit someone who is resisting 100% without ripping the submission/having no control. I don't really want to change this, as I want people to reciprocate that kindness to me and not injure me. It has worked so far. I also keep track of people who I feel would not be kind and tap quick. I'm hoping my technique will supplement this in the future 

The second problem is, I never know what to go for when I get mount. The submissions I usually go for are kimuras from bottom, americanas/arm locks from side, RNCs, omoplatas, arm bars, or straight ankle locks. When I get mount I have no idea what to do because when I try any submission my partner will post me or hip bump me off them. Or some will just muscle out of it.

I shoot for a double leg which he stuffs. The boy couldn't be moved it was insane. I'm white belt of white belt tier, haven't hit the mats for a while due to working insane overtime hours. I eventually land some kind of goofy O Soto Gari but instead of throwing him we both just ended up tumbling. He gets into my guard which is great, but his pressure from the top is still insane as, once again, I'm new and only just doing some shit I've browsed in this sub and some escape/sweep drills. He's got forearm pressure on my neck in a kind of half Ezekiel, and I will forever feel the pain of every white belt who cops one, my neck is killing me. I get into closed guard and squeeze his torso with my hips to pull him in and shove his arm aside, and then shoot my legs up for a triangle, and he tries again for the forearm pressure. I get my right leg free and snatch his left arm for some kind of half assed armbar which I luck out on as he doesn't really know how to defend it and taps.

I was thinking for my upcoming one of doing some light jogging with heart rate in around 130-150 Bpm for 20-30 minutes.

So looking for some advice from seasoned competitors here- I've heard rolling before is a great idea, I've found its difficult to implement this as a lot of my teammates are either watching or competing themselves during this time. 

Many thanks",subs,bjj

919,"So my current personal project is seriously working on my open guard and flowing from position to position while in open guard. My previous bottom game was mostly wrestle ups,shin to shin into single leg x or a double leg, or half guard if it gets dicey. 

An aspect of that I’m having issues with is that space between getting the grips and pulling someone into something (in this case de la riva) , I have watched videos on how to make a hook tight and all but the biggest issue I’m having is as soon as I start trying to set up , I get danced around or my opponent back steps to Kneebar me . As a result I’m resorting to keeping my feet at their hip and stretching them out , which sometimes works okay but other times I have no idea how to progress from this position. My guard retention is okay , I’m just having a hard time getting attack to flow . Does anyone have any good videos or advice on how to address this ?",subs,bjj

I'm a recent arrival to Brisbane and have been looking to make my spotty BJJ history a bit more consistent by signing up to a gym here.

For location reasons and through some googling I've decided it'll be either Arte Suave or Open Mat Jiu Jitsu.

Does anybody have experience with these gyms at all? 

Personally I'm leaning towards Open Mat Jiu Jitsu more as they have a no lock in contract weekly rate that they have on their Instagram whereas I don't know what I'm in for with Arte Suave in terms of cost.

I see the reviews are great for both gyms and they look like they're both amazing but it's always good to hear customers feedback so please shoot! or if you know anything about Arte's pricing that might help to.

So a while ago are used to live with an alcoholic his daily routine was when he comes home from work he starts drinking, warm Coors banquet because he drinks so many that it doesn’t make sense to put them in the fridge. Once he’s had about 10 he starts drinking vodka all the while he’s taking enormous dabs after he’s done with about half a handle of vodka he ends the night with half a bottle of whiskey needless to say at the end of the night he’s black out and he’s a cool guy, but no one’s cool when they’re black out drunk so he’s always been chill and maybe he’ll push my buttons but I never respond. He plays World of Warcraft the whole time and sometimes he doesn’t have a good game or some shit the way he described it is his character is the healer so on a 50 person raid everyone needs him so his character has a lot of pressure or some 

So, on this particular night, he had a lot of people arguing with him on WOW and it’s 1 AM so he’s thrashed and he comes out very angry while me and my little brother (who’s visiting) are sitting on an L-shaped couch, and he starts calling my little brother names, because I think he tried talking shit to me, but I didn’t react so he started picking on my little brother and in a way that drunk people awkwardly say insults specifically trying to start fights, so I’m starting to get concerned, because he’s 6’3 240lbs and I am 5’8 140lbs so I’m worried about the safety of my little brother at this point and he steps closer to us so I stand up push him over the couch so he does a backflip and when he gets up I pull him into a triangle I don’t choke him, but then he has his outside arm still near his neck (near my crotch), and he tries to squeeze my balls very maliciously (that’s the best word I can use to describe it honestly) so I remove his hand that’s inside and start to squeeze tight but then he realizes that I could kill him and he stopped fighting so I stop choking but I still hold him in the choke and after two minutes I feel that he has gotten the point I let him go then he stands up and awkwardly goes into his room. I go into my room which is next to his and he comes back out saying his neck hurts and that he’s pissed, acting like he wants to fight, as soon as I feel threatened I pull his head into a guillotine and i hold this tight but never enough to choke him but I make it uncomfortable until he stops fighting then I pretend like I’m letting him go and he starts going crazy again so I tighten it back up very tight so he looses some air and that scared him enough to know if I had to do it again I probably was gonna choke him out. Then he leaves very angrily and breaks some shit in his room, I have my little brother sleep with me and we locked the doors, I was scared all night but happy to see that jiu jitsu kept all three of us safe, no punches",subs,bjj

980,"I'm a huge bodybuilder with tremendous strength. Truly a sight to behold. After scrolling on youtube and seeing a video of some guy beating up The Mountain in what seemed like some weird brazilian martial art i decided to give it go.

I searched for a gym near my place and soon enough there I was at my first ever BJJ course.

It started with some easy warm-up, nothing out of the ordinary for an extremely fit guy like myself. Afterwards the coach showed us some moves. It seemed really easy and natural when he was doing them, but for me, due to my out of the ordinary muscle developpement, it was quite difficult to replicate. 

After half an hour or so the session was near to it's end and the coach announced it's ""playtime"".

I quickly understood it's time to fight. Everybody chose his partener by rising their hand and waiting for someone (who also had a reaised arm) to approach them and proposes a battle.

A scrawny guy with a white belt and some black stripes approached me. This was becoming interesting as no one of that laughable size had ever dared to challange me to a combat due to my enormous stature.  

We did some weird hand gesture and it was on. We tried to push eachother for a while and at a moment the scrawny guy felt to the ground in what strangely seemed to be a voluntary act. I swiftly jumped on top of him and in a flash I grabed his head in a headlock and began to squeeze with all of my might. I could not see his face but his eyes seemed like they were popping out of his head from the pressure, his breathing was becoming really weird like he was having an asthma attack and although at the beggining he was struggling after a few seconds he stopped doing that (even tough he din't \[completely\] pass out). I continued to squeeze as hard as I could for almost a whole minute but he refused to give up. 

At this point I let him go and he started to show some signs of life again. We got into a wild scramble and I ended up behind. I had 0 technique but I kept really tight onto him like a beetle that burrows deep into the dung bubble. Afterwards I crossed my hands in a hugging motion around his neck and starded hugging really really hard. After 20 secondes or so the coach whistled: the round was over.

The guy got back up. His head was in a rather unnatural postion and  you could have (wrongly) assume he looked beat up but the truth was: he din't tap, he dind't give up, he beat me to the mental game. 

It was at that moment that I realised I wanted to become a juijiteiro.",subs,bjj

For context, I have been to 4 different gyms, and met many different types of coaches, not all of them were bad people, there really only is one I can say I did not like. 

I’ve (M20) been training for over a year and I just can’t improve. I trained 2-3 times a week for the first 7 months and I feel like I get so confused and get so stressed before and after every class. I get beat up and constantly scolded for not improving along side the other students who joined along side the same time as me. 

No matter how many classes I go to, how much out of class practice I do, how many videos I watch, books I read, and lectures I listen to, I just get smashed and smashed and bruised and cut and every class ends the same. I go to my car feeling like a worthless person and I just sob for half an hour. 

I do my best to bring a good vibe to the gym, I don’t complain, I crack wise with the other guys, and we most of the time we have nice conversations. However, these twenty something blue belts who wanna rip my joints out of my sockets and “teach” me by ripping submission and telling me what im doing wrong (btw, instead of giving me a chance to get light pressure in the position I failed at to get better, they just stay at the same pressure and state “nobody is gonna be nice to you in a match, get used to it!”). I almost wish I was a girl, because when I see them train with the same guys or other girls, they joke, they drill, they have a good time! I want that! Patty the Baddy said it best while discussing men’s mental health, “I’d rather have my best friend cry on my shoulder than to show up to his funeral” (or something to that effect), but I feel like if I cried to my coach or fellow students, I would be the outcast of the gym. 

However, whenever I do striking classes (boxing and Muay Thai) I have so much fun! We laugh, we train, we work hard, and we build a family together.

Today I was matched with an upper belt that completely smashed me in what I felt for the first time as something unreasonably rough. The issue is that I'm pretty new and I tap immediately to pain or an imminent choke, but some of these chokes are really hard to identify as a beginner to recognize. I was submitted like 7 times in 5 minutes and all 7 chokes were directly on my trachea. Most of them were fine and would've left my throat hurting any way, but there was one where it felt like I was clotheslined and flipped over from one side of his body to the other. I tapped at the beginning of the ""roll"" but he didn't let go until I flipped from one side of his body to the other.

Just very annoyed and disappointed and ranting about it now online. I tap to almost everything and I have no problem tapping, but this one move really messed up my throat and has me coughing blood. I genuinely feel like I tapped as fast and early as I could. Maybe a more experienced grappler would know that it's coming and tap sooner, but I'm not that experienced.

I legit have 0 subs and got subbed maybe 5 times per roll and I don't care at all. I'm here to learn and have no ego. All the other rnc and chokes I tapped and it was whatever, but this one was ridiculously painful. Just discourages me so much. Any way thanks for reading this rant.",subs,bjj

The only good thing that came from this, is I actually understand  how annoying it is wanting to practice bjj and the guy thinks we're in the jungle and it's life or death, and I thought to myself, that's probably how other people feel when they roll with me and I spaz on them, so it helped me calm down my own game.

Why do people do this? Congrats bro you know I've just told you it's my first time back after barely even starting to begin with and you tell me let's go light then try to kill me.. you feel cool or what?",subs,bjj

1043,"On the Lex Fridman podcast, John Danaher made the claim that Gordon Ryan would lose to the average chimpanzee **1000 times out of 1000**. Citing that their strength gives them an extraordinary advantage over humans. It is my contention that this is an insulting estimate. 

As a chimpanzee enthusiast, I can say that Coach Danaher is wildly over-estimating the strength of these animals. I believe he's referencing the common misconception on chimp strength - that they are 5 to 10x stronger than their human counterparts. 

Well, science has actually done studies and found that chimpanzees are only 1.5x times stronger than human beings. (Source: [pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28652350/)) It appears that the true advantage of chimpanzee strength is in the higher percentage of fast-twitch muscle fibers (70% for chimps vs 50% for humans). This is useful information because it allows us to strategize our approach to the dilemma we face.

Let's now turn our attention to the most important part of our analysis. Size. The average chimpanzee is around 4'11'', and 122lbs. In contrast, Gordon Ryan at his most Acai'd out is a staggering 6'2'' shredded 250lbs. Gordon Ryan looks like an actual silver back gorilla next to the average chimp. And, moreover, Gordon Ryan knows the principles of leverage and fulcrum - he is able to demonstrate tremendous breaking pressure against the chimpanzee, so that his effective strength is probably far, far stronger than the brute methods of the chimp. If I had to guess, Gordon Ryan's effective strength probably varies between 25x and 300x that of the average chimpanzee. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main issue that Gordon is going to face in these 1000 battles is the fear of getting his balls and eyes ripped out by the chimpanzee. I admit this is where Danaher earns his bread and butter. However, I feel that as these matches go on, and Gordon revives back to life, he will likely get over this fear and be able to exert his will on the chimp. Really, he doesn't really need his balls in this context. So he'd likely cover his face with his arms and rush the chimpanzee, letting his genitals act as a sort of decoy, such that he can get the beast down to the ground and quickly finish the fight with a well-placed kata-gatame. One of the few strangles that allows Gordon to end the fight without direct body-to-body contact.

&amp;#x200B;

My estimate? Gordon takes about **100-300 fights out of 1000.** It's still pretty unbalanced going toe-to-toe with a chimpanzee, but this asymmetry is largely due to the fear component of facing an agressive and sadistic creature, not necessarily that creature's physical attributes.",subs,bjj
1044,"I’m pretty much a knuckle dragger who mainly approaches rolling by only moving when there’s an opening and try to pressure pass at all time but whenever I watch the higher belts or athletes roll, they always seem to find the right moment to execute the appropriate move, be it to sweep, submit, escape or just chaining all of those together.

I know it’s just familiarising the positions of each technique and seeing the reaction of your partner but I feel like I’m pretty dumb or single minded to the point that I only do things one move at a time rather than being a head or creating quick scenarios in my head to anticipate what’s happening. Does anyone know how do you train your fight IQ as whenever I roll, the second someone goes hard, any plan goes out the window and I just try to do whatever I think is appropriate based on my reaction.",subs,bjj

1049,"TL;DR: I try to define what ""hobbyist+"" is, explain what hasn't worked for me so far in BJJ training, and what type of advice I'm looking for.

It's a long post, hoping to connect with others in the same situation. It would be nice to see a few sincere responses among the shitposts ;)

Disclaimer: my school is awesome in many ways and I’m not looking to change. Their instruction level is absolutely fine, and based on my travels, better than average. I’m looking to do much better than average when I can.

**What's a hobbyist+?**

Think about those dads who get deep into cycling or WW2 history or whatever. Late 30s to early 50s, new hobby, lots of spare time and a bit of disposable income.

I think there's a growing segment of those folks in BJJ and I'm one of them. We have time, we want to be the best we can be while setting reasonable expectations. We lack physicality and stamina but we're dedicated, focused on learning (and know how we learn best), and are passionate about the sport and our growth within it and within our limitations. 

**What is the issue?**

Training approaches in BJJ are split between promising practitioners and competitors, and hobbyists. 

The former are the ones who (rightfully) get the most attention from coaches, create recognition for their gym, progress quickly through belts and compete/medal at major events. They have special sessions, tailored S&amp;C programs, and active coaching to work on their weaknesses. 

The latter are the ones who hang out in the gym, train a couple of days a week, are told to “just show up”, progress at their own pace, and are Reddit’s fodder for “I’m a two stripe white belt but I just heel hooked a 55 year old purple belt where is my promotion”.

There’s rarely a middle ground for people who won’t or can’t fit the former group but are more committed to fit in the latter. Coaches don’t invest as often in anyone other than the top competitors, because they have limited time and resources. That leaves the hobbyist+ group to take responsibility for their own progress.

**Dude, just train more**

This isn’t good enough advice for two reasons:

First, I do train more. I’m a bored middle aged dad with a boring job so I have 8 hours a week of drilling/rolling, at least double that in research and solo work, and several more hours of S&amp;C and cardio. I am working my way to more hours in a safe way but more time isn’t the answer in my case.

Second, research about training has shown again and again that being **purposeful** about your training gets better results. As much as I enjoy training I don’t want to just roll and see what comes out. I’d like to be more thoughtful about it. It may not be your thing but it is mine.

**What are my questions?**

How do you set measurable goals for progress? Belts are too subjective. I’m not interested in “winning” in practice drilling. Competitions are fine but the competitor pool is limited unless I start traveling internationally for competitions (I’m based in a small country in Europe).

How do you evaluate your skill level vs. where it should be for your mat hours? I haven’t tried black belt video reviews. Have you found them helpful?

How do you structure practice for improving on a skill you know you lack at? In my case, when I have a specific question I research on YouTube and often ask in BJJ Mental Models’ Discord, then start all my rolls from that position until I’ve made progress. I’m just not sure what enough progress is given I have so many different areas to work on.

That’s it for now. Looking forward to a good discussion.",subs,bjj
1050,"frame against someone's neck when I'm in their half guard or something but I'm on top? I'm a good bit smaller and/or weaker than most of my rolling partners.

I was watching UFC last night. Glover who's very high level in bjj one of the best in the UFC no doubt. But since he's Brazilian and is old school he always looks to get to mount and this is the 2nd fight in a row where he gets to mount and the opponent just rolls over and he loses the position and got thrown on bottom

It costed him the fight twice if he was in half guard or side control he could have found a submission since he's such a great finisher.",subs,bjj
1059,"Fair warning that I'm completely new to bjj and this is likely dumb white belt stuff. 

I was rolling in class with another white belt and in two scenarios I was apparently not flowing: I stayed in side control for like 2 minutes straight. I just heard a fundamental ""tip"" to control the shoulder closer to you so they can't turn to you as easily. This stalled the match as neither of us were good enough to escape or submit one another. 

The second time was when I was turtled up and he grabbed a rnc, but I knew from a video that the bottom hooks matter a lot. So as he's trying to rnc me when on top of me in turtle, I use both hands to clear one of the hooks, then fall to that side. The rnc didn't work, and then I get back into turtle with elbows tight to my body and I literally just turtled for at least a minute until the round ended.

I know that it's on the partner to know how to escape / maneuver around this, but the counterargument could be that they lack the knowledge to do so, it'd be more productive to advance to a different position like open guard so we can both practice something we know rather than get stuck in side control or turtle for a few minutes.

This is just white belt stuff lol but I do wonder if it has any legitimacy. Also curious if my two ""fundamental"" tips are accurate.",subs,bjj

1103,"After the first two years, you will probably need conditioning outside of jiujitsu. 
After trying steady state cardio, HIIT and strength training, separately, for about 6 months each, strength training comes out on top.
I did feel improvement with cardio and intervals, but they were definitely little things like having a little more gas in the tank and recovering faster between rounds. 
Strength and mass is different, the applications and improvements are huge and extremely noticeable.
People can’t get away from your grips, small movements to better positions are easier. Also, my muscles do not get “pumped” nearly as much, leading to more pressure for much longer. Also, techniques work much better, they feel super powered. Just for fun, i collar dragged my buddy at hard as I possible could, he flew across the room, very fun feeling. 
Finally, I’ve taken a time off of cardio and intervals, and the benefit almost completely disappears, without almost constant maintenance, but with strength, after some time off, I actually feel stronger.
Another thing is accessibility and time. Research is showing you can can get strength training benefit throughout the day that it doesn’t need to be one long session. Steady state and HIIT need at least 20 minutes of dedication taken out of the day, but you can bust out a set of push ups or pull ups or body weight squats wherever, it’ll take a minute and if you do that throughout the day, that’s plenty of strength building signal, so you can train whenever and wherever.

I said ""alright"" and told him Id be there next class.

1140,"Hey all, I am 5ft 5 and weight 61kg (134 pounds) 

All I have done since doing BJJ has been trying to figure my game slowly and trying different things out.

I’m starting to understand the BJJ small game, points I learned are:

1. Stay on top

2. Don’t let them control your neck 

3. Use your speed (with right tech)

4. Drill tech that works for you

5. When stuck under big heavy guys, slow down wait for a reaction and exploit.

6. Understand Transitions well and execute them with speed

7. Some sweeps don’t work with big guys. 

8. Grips are everything 

9. Jumping guards and movement is easier

10. Understand your opponent and use your brain as much as you can to decipher them. 

11. Crafty sneaky subs work the best. 

As a small guy I wanted to share what I feel has helped my game. What else tips does anyone have or disagrees with me I would love to know!",subs,bjj
1141,"I demoted myself.

I’ve been doing Jiu Jitsu since 2016. Consistently took a year off (before my blue belt, I know, shocker) came back, competed regularly, placed. Nothing crazy. Just basic hobby-ist- got my purple the end of 2020 . Then decided to join the military and before I shipped I was given my brown belt. 

Honestly, it feels like it was a going away gift and I don’t feel like I earned it. Every belt and stripe I felt it coming, but not this one. Fast forward now a year and a few months later if army crap and it’s time to find a new gym. But I’m placing my brown belt up as motivation and continuing to wear my purple . 
I didn’t compete in brown nor did I ever even roll in it since getting it(Besides at basic training with mostly non trained people)

1152,"Hey guys - I have a bit of a problem and I’m hoping someone can give me advice. I’ve been training for about 2 years now about 3x a week. Last year I had my first run in with cauliflower ear. It was small. I got it drained, I compressed it with some magnets, I wore headgear and it healed with minimal deformity. 

Last month was a different experience. I got it on the other ear. It swelled up, not too big, on the top of my ear (very top of the ear, under the fold). I drained it, compressed with magnets, and wore headgear. Same monster right? Wrong. It still got roughed up and grew 3x larger. I drained it again a few days later, and took a couple days off. Compressed it all day; but kept taking the magnets and stuff off my ear in my sleep. Fast forward to over 30 days later, and it just won’t harden or stop. I took 10 days off, compressing every day. It hardened in one spot, and I went back to rolling last night with headgear on. I didn’t get hit in it, but it got bigger again. I know what some of you are thinking; “just keep it bro” but it’s not that easy. I work in the legal field, and I need to be as presentable and professional as possible. I don’t know exactly what I’m asking. Basically, I guess, has anyone else had a fight with their cauliflower ear? Did you have any tricks that helped you train without it swelling up?  Has anyones cauli still been soft after a month? 

I’m extremely fed up with this, and I really just want to leave it at this point. But it’s about the size of the tip of my pinky now, in the top of my ear. I really don’t want this $h!t anymore.

My name is Randy but most everyone just calls me Ox. I'm 39, 6' 0 tall, and I weigh 253 lbs. currently.  


I set up 5 different meetups at 5 different schools. They all offer 3–5-day trials and I discussed that I'm trying different schools, so ""Can I please break my 3 free classes into 3 weeks? /5 classes over 3 weeks?  
I figured this would allow me to really experience what each school has to offer. Here's the names of the schools I'm signed up with for free trials:  


Gracie Barra Brazilian Jui Jitsu  
Sakubara Academy  
RGV Fight Club  
80/20 Jui Jitsu  
RGVFA (RGV Fight Alliance)  


I went to the Gracie gym last night and just watched from the sidelines. I suffer from crippling social anxiety, stemming from PTSD, because I'm at home every day and usually just around my family.  


Mid way through the class, the man who was checking everyone in at the front desk walked over ot me and started a discussion. It was nice to just kick back and see the class training while this guy (Who I found out was one of the teachers, but he just tore his ACL) and talk about our favorite fighters and his opinion on why Gracie is a great school. First, they're getting ready to change the name to Enzo Gracie Fight School (Or something like that) and secondly, they will be offering an MMA class at 6 AM 5 days a week.  


The things I looked for when making my free lessons was an institution that had a good size and was clean, Students seemed to be happy and enjoying working together (No bullies from what I can see), that the students truly respect their teacher, and most importantly: That you can go to as many lessons or classes per month as you want AND that they offer BJJ + some form of striking.  


All the quotes were about the same with a few bucks extra here and a few bucks less over here. Some give you a Gi, pants, and a belt for free, some of them charge. In fact, a couple of schools require that you not only buy head to toe fight gear, but you HAVE TO buy it DIRECTLY from the school at a humongous mark up.   


I know this is a long post, so thank you for reading and hopefully sharing your opinion or                                                    things to look out for below!

1190,"I'm 14/f and I have a white belt with two stripes. I've been doing this sport since late June of 2022. A month ago I realized I did not enjoy this sport at all not even from the beginning. I just didn't wanna disappoint my dad (whose actually passionate in it and worries about me being by myself and not knowing how to protect myself) and I just wanted to keep seeing the friends I made there. Those friends are no longer in the same class as me, they're now in the intermediate class. Without them, I realized wow I did not like it at all. I found it tedious like with karate. I guess contact sports aren't my thing... Today, me and my dad were having a conversation and I admitted to him that I hated it (a part of me didn't wanna say cuz I didn't wanna disappoint him), I told him that I wanted to do cheerleading (something I actually practice at home and wanna do for fun). My dad told me that he's frustrated cuz he doesn't get why I wanna do it (even though I've told him) because I quit gymnastics back in 3rd grade which I regret but I lost interest in it because him and my mom were making comments saying it was a waste of money and I can just learn how to do that stuff at home so I quit ( they were very unmotivating). He said that cheerleading's gay and why would I wanna cheer for other people playing real sports. He also said how's cheerleading gonna benefit me in life?how will it get me into a college like Harvard? He said he knows I'm gonna regret cuz he just knows cuz I'm his kid. From the beginning when I just started him and my mom asked me if I was sure I liked it and I don't need to pretend to like it and I said yes. Now I regret it, I'm so frustrated in myself. From my pov, I was doing this mainly for my dad not me! My dad told me today even if I didn't like it he'd still force me which is kinda ironic because he has said millions of times before he doesn't want to get me to do something I don't wanna do. I'm rlly regretting this rn. I'm kinda mad at myself because I'm stuck with a sport I hate until the next decade cuz I promised my dad I'll be a black belt. I don't wanna sound dramatic but I'm so frustrated in myself I almost cried just thinking about it while I was in the shower today.

Anyways, he doesn't have many submissions besides americana, and whenever he grabs my head he just starts squeezing it as hard as he can. It is never enough to finish me, and usually after half a minut or so I can get out and finish him, but it hurts like a mthrfcker and leaves my face hella bruised and my lips and cheeks get cut on my teeth. Today he did the same thing and I just tapped because I didn't care enough to spend up to a minute or two getting my face crushed, even though it wasn't something I would tap to in a tournament or any match that mattered. 

For reference the position where he usually tries this is when I have his back with both hooks, but he reaches his arm around and grabs my head and squeezes with all his might. Usually his arms get tired after a minute and I can secure the back take and get a rear naked.

For the most part the class was going well and was really helpful for me. We started doing a takedown drill and I was up against a black belt who has a ton of experience. It started out ok, I was holding off his attempts and trying to control position when he dropped down for a scissor takedown.

1261,"Seems that adage that if you your main aim of rolls is winning you're learning slower than someone who focuses on developing technique by putting themselves in bad positions and trying new techniques. That kinda makes sense but is it really true?

My main coach has a habit of telling us before rolling  that it isn't about winning but learning BJJ. But how is that mutually exclusive? And are you really learning slower by trying to win?

I can't think of any other sport where winning is seen as a bad thing. In wrestling or Judo winning is everything, especially wrestling those guys go to war during training and you better do everything possible to make the team or you're going to get cut.
Same applies to pretty much every sport and pretty much every adversarial persuit I can think of. Winning is number one.

Seems like a lot of people have bit egos and hide their loses behind saying ""it's not about winning"" or ""you can't lose in training"". It's up there with ""Don't use strength"". Pathetic excuses instead of owning up to the fact someone can be better than you. If someone is obsessed with winning they're likely trying harder, training more and will do what it takes to keep winning. They're not learning slower they're learning BJJ faster than you.",subs,bjj

1273,"Was talking to a friend who has trained with me since about 2005. He said something interesting, and I wanted to see if others feel the same way.  

He said: 
- back in the day, the vast majority of ‘good’ guys were actual real people who embodied what it meant to be a martial artist ie. had real jobs, family, responsibilities, but trained 3-5 times a week, to build skills, body and mind. 
- they used competition as a means to test themselves and their progress in a respectful and dignified way, embodying that martial art spirit 
- since pro JJ has taken off the talent is obviously through the roof, but the athletes are one dimensional ppl, with no real responsibility for people or their community (generalisation here, but you take the point). This has gone hand in hand with a drop off in manners, respectful behaviour and sportsmanship.

First off absolutely loving this dvd and its one of my all time favourite instructionals!

For those that have watched and had success with Craigs DVD - I have a question.

So say I have split the legs and or sitting on the legs from 3/4 mount- opponents legs are somewhat pinned shall we say.

I have my opponent crossfaced and perhaps manage to get the other arm-hand cuff style.

I am struggling to flatten them out from here- my partner at the weekend denied it really well- he kinda like arched his back to the side so I couldn't apply considerable pressure to break him down- was super annoying, it was kinda similar to how you attempt to flatten people out with both hooks- when they kinda go on to their side to stop the attempt?

My coach also held a meeting with the gym and said we should focus on lowering the intensity and to not try to muscle our way to submissions because most likely if we have to do that then we aren’t using proper technique. So I really feel like I should adopt this idea of rolling light at low intensity and to focus on technicality.

The other portion of me looks at wrestling. I also train wrestling and we are definitely more intense, aggressive, and explosive. So it seems like the opposite from what is expected in BJJ.

I'm having an absolutely brutal time with cutting considering I've got to be down another 3.5kg in the next 13 days to weigh in at 70kg in the gi. I constantly feel cold and hungry and mentally it's all I can do to stop myself from crying all the time. I feel fucking awful. Half of me wants to push through this crucible as I'll only come out the other side much stronger and more resilient from a mental perspective, and the other half of me hopes I get a minor injury that prevents me from competing just so I can feel somewhat normal again.

I know that eventually I can easily, healthily walk around at 70kg year-round and use that as a base to either cut 2kg during comp prep with minimal stress or even decide to bulk up to compete at Lightweight in the future - either way to just be able to make the best decision with regards to which weight class is the best for my health and lifestyle long term.

So to those guys who compete at a high level. Do you cut at all? And if so, how much do you cut from the weight you usually walk around at?

* Sumo - Push/Pull your opponent out of bounds or until they fall. Trains maintaining balance, grip fighting and off balancing your opponent.
* Clothespin Grip Fighting - Attach wooden clothes pins to common grip areas of the gi and practice denying grips to those areas while trying to grab the clothes pins off your opponent.

Got a gi for Christmas and figured I’d head down to the class and try it.

I figured these guys were blue belts, purple belts etc. 

Turned up last night. These guys are all 3-stripe white belts. 

It was at that exact moment I realised how out of my depth I was. Holy shit.

But after doing a practice explanation of how to do arm bar and triangle from closed guard, my coach recommends that I start from a different approach. Like more basic techniques and self defense focused, and less on bjj as a sport (ex: kimura from closed guard and basic mount escape on day 1). Then work my way up from there.

1381,"The level of striking in heavyweight PFL mma is not that dangerous compared to the level of takedowns Gordon can offer. I get that Gordon ryan isn’t a takedown specialist in ADCC but he does have above average takedowns  

The guy can take down and submit actual ADCC champions in like 40 seconds so a fat 6-5 PFL fighter would be easy


He could have a hilarious moment where he takes down a fat heavyweight that no one has ever heard of

Other fighters should ideally speak very little English and be totally oblivious of the next 

He could proceed to act out a publicity stunt joke skit where he literally just performs an entire instructional of Jiu-Jitsu submissions, never cranking them hard enough to invoke a tap on a terrible PFL heavyweight

And when I say “publicity stunt joke skit” I don’t mean it’s a faked performance I mean he genuinely mauls a heavyweight bum over at PFL every PFL event and loudly talks about Jiu-Jitsu to the camera for 15 minutes until he changes his instructional theme next fight, and then next fight, all the way until the finale where we get a 25 minute instructional

At the finale he should call out Dana White and jorge masvidal and put his BMF belt on the line when he does, which is obviously impossible, and then argue that his mma career is done since there’s no legacy greater than the PFL belt other than the UFC BMF belt which Gordon should claim jorge is “ducking from defending” 

Bonus points if he calls masvidal “Jose madator” and acts serious as he says it too

And we just have a whole PFL season of Gordon ryan releasing free instructionals on PFL canon fodder

Enough ufc viewers would probably watch just to meme it that PFL would get actual UFC level viewership for a while, and grappling fans would get so much free knowledge

He then would have such a huge stock returning to the next ADCC AFTER This event that ADCC would have the viewership of the entire mma world

Rn I do 7-10 sessions Monday to Friday. I dont feel worn out that often, sometimes at the end of a Friday session I’m very happy with a weekend off but that’s only natural I guess lol. My plan is to cut carbs completely, which I have started, and I understand this will have an effect on my energy levels. I’m ok with doing a couple less sessions in the week to accommodate this. I think it’s the most plausible way to lose the weight though, especially with the loss of water weight that comes with a low carb diet.

But there are obvious downsides: 

- Meeting roughness with roughness only increases roughness. It emphasizes the roughness. It agrees that roughness is a solution.

- likely, the nee guy didn’t understand that he was going too rough, and „scaring“ him into cooperating might be counter-productive. It might instead teach him, that he is being not rough enough, not fast enough, not brutal enough.

Instead, we can talk to people. And if they‘re the kind of person that won’t listen, maybe they’re not the right person for our team.

After bjj blue I stopped training several years and went to a new school with a good reputation. I felt my blue belt that Id just received before stopping wouldn't be to the new clubs level especially after the break. I put the white belt on thinking the coach will promote me when ready, that was 4 years ago. (probably a mistake in hindsight, some benefits too at least). 

At white I had an advantage over my peers, however came up at the same progression rate. Which was fine as I'd made a decision.

People that started after me have caught up in rank. I train usually 5 times weekly. Rolling wise with blues I dominate if I want to, I usually tap the purples most rolls  and some browns too. Even when being dominated I can usually survive without being tapped. 

It's not really bothered me until the last six months or so when I thought about training partners conversations, levels and the amount of training and study I do weekly. Obtaining a purple belt skill level/ belt has been the goal since starting back.

Here are the top 3 things you should teach a beginner in their first Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu classes:

1. Basic techniques: These should include the fundamental positions (e.g. guard, side control, mount) and movements (e.g. escapes, transitions, submissions) that form the foundation of BJJ.

2. Safety and hygiene: It is important to prioritize safety and maintain good hygiene in the training environment, particularly for beginners who may not be familiar with the sport.

3. Respect for training partners and instructors: BJJ is a martial art that emphasizes respect and discipline, and it is important for beginners to understand the importance of these values.

In addition to these core concepts, you may also want to introduce beginners to BJJ terminology, the importance of a strong mental game, the concept of leverage, and how to drill techniques.

My takedowns, guard and leg locks are my strongest attributes (no gi only)

Today I am having one of those weird anxiety moments where you replay rolls from months ago and feel poor about them. 

I am 6'2 210lbs lean and I am obsessed with strength and conditioning so I have a pretty big athletic advantage against most people even if they are bigger and stronger. This sounds like a brag but its makes the whole thing worse lol.

Around 3 months back I was rolling with a 18 year old 150lb 3 stripe white belt who within our first round I submitted from playing open guard within 30 seconds. I repeated this success the 2nd round but on the third I ended up stuck in his closed guard until the timer went. He had not a single successful attack or even grip during this time, yet I didnt escape. The issue is that I didnt even really try as I have developed this weird mental block to where when I am in someones closed guard, if they stall like this guy did, I dont even attempt an escape as I know Im poor at it. 

All of this makes me feel like I dont deserve my rank and makes me feel a bit down about how good I am as truthfully a 200lb+ purple should blitz through a white belt closed guard. I know none of this matters and I know that even blacks get caught by a good blue rarely so please dont ego check me lol. This is an issue I have with every person im against and one benefit it has provided is that I dont entertain peoples closed guards to the point where I am very successful in not being caught in a open/closed guard to start with. I maybe get caught in a closed guard once a month as Ill just stand and pass. But when they stall, I fall to pieces.

Been training about 16 months, consistently. 

The last three months I’ve had higher belts coming up and tell me, Oh you’ll be promoted soon, I’d have promoted you by now, you deserve your blue belt, you feel like a blue belt etc. 

I was half expecting based on these comments to get my blue belt. 

I haven’t got it yet, and I just feel disheartened. 

I don’t know what I’ve to do to get over the line. 

Now I know full well that it’s just the belt color and that I’ll still be the exact same but people from the beginners intake are getting their blue belts, and they don’t train as often as I do (I’m there 4-5 days a week). 

This is impacting me wanting to train, and when I have a bad training session, which happens I know, I’m literally like “What the fuck am I doing this for anymore, I’m
Not getting anywhere with this shit.”

I know a lot of it is disappointment from ego, expectations and self pity but I literally have been in this funk for a month and can’t get out of it, barely trained over Christmas to get a break.

We had a new bloke start with our gym in October last year.

He's mid 30's, in shape and a decent enough lad.

He is absolutely terrified of BJJ. Literally almost irrational fear level anxious.

It's now gotten to the point that people are actively avoiding training with him unless they are forced to because of no one else being left to partner with.

Anytime you go to drill a technique with him, it's almost like a comedy sketch where he covers his bollocks with his hands or tries to push you away from locking in tight, etc.

It's really hard to explain what he does without you physically seeing it. It's almost as if he thinks his training partners are on fire and if they touch him he will burn. It's really, really bizarre.

If you do manage to do the drill, he will tap before a single bit of pressure is applied, etc.

He will not roll either and sits it out.

He explicitly states he has no injuries or past injuries he is concerned with.

Regardless of the above, I hate to see that people are now avoiding him and I want to help him but I don't know how I can without just sort of saying get a grip pal.

Quick back story: I started my first academy when I was 24 years old then I sold my academy at 33.  I was fortunate to get some amazing experience running that business, honing my coaching skills, and building a team. 

Then, at 33, I sold my academy to work 100% online. During the past 9 years, the Grapplers Guide has grown an unimaginable amount. I'm married, have two kids and two dogs, and have been able to experience what it's like to have an autonomous lifestyle. 

Now 18 years later, with 22 years of BJJ experience, 13 of them as a black belt, 9 years of past experience as an academy owner, and another 9 years, I know what it's like to train at many places with the perspective of a coach and academy owner, I am now opening an academy once again.

At the age of 42, I can honestly say that I feel my BJJ is better than it was when I got my black belt at 29. However, I am getting older. The body hits up with surprises, and I still want to keep BJJ in my life.

I have decided to open an academy again, not because of money but because of love. I am fortunate to understand the business of BJJ very well, so I do feel the academy will be extremely successful, but it's nice to go into it with a completely different perspective with so much past experience in my BJJ life.

I will be documenting a lot of my journey, for business and for the public, and I am going to be doing some really cool and what I feel to be different things compared to most places.

I look forward to getting people really good at BJJ based on what they can achieve. I look forward to giving people an outlet to use this art as a way to get away from ""life.""

Mainly, my coach is not invested in my progress, I don't feel supported, and I do not like my own dynamic with the social clique there.

1589,"I’ve noticed that a larger majority of Russian success is seen in the spotlight of mma for having severely dominant top pressure and great takedowns. But you rarely see Russians at ADCC, if anything you see a lot of Finnish guys winning the  European trials. My theory is that a large majority of Russians transition into combat Sambo and mma rather then sticking to just grappling, and the others stick to wrestling like Sadulaev. To where as  America’s best wrestlers/judo/jiu Jitsu guys will stick to grappling into their 20’s and then try to transition, which leaves them about 10 years behind the Russians who transitioned as teens.

I need an opinion on Bulletproofforbjj VS Juggernautbjj. I researched both apps online and couldn't reach a conclusion on what would be best for me. I am a 30 year old blue belt, I have been lifting since I was 18 and doing BJJ for the last 5 years. 

During the last year I used a personal trainer for S&amp;C and it was great , I had less injuries and I felt more prepared for the comps I did than in the years prior, however due to financial issues I am no longer able to afford it . I searched online and came across Bulletproofforbjj VS Juggernautbjj but I cant seem to decide which one would benefit me more.

1604,"So I’ve been very confused by Jiu Jitsu the past 6 months but I have started to understand the game. I didn’t understand bottom game , why choose to be bottom side control bottom half , defend guard ect . But what I’ve realised is there’s a lot of guards and positions you can play on bottom which are pretty good at getting you to submissions or the back. I have been starting roles with butterfly guard as I know a few sweeps from there and in Gi I have been using a cross collar grip to reduce their options for passing : if they go one way I have a choke , if they body lock I have a guillotine, if they lean back I have a sweep, stay I have a few sweeps , I’m also working on submissions from guard like straight armlock-kimura-triangle . usually they stand up so I transition to X guard . I have been trying to get the back but I  fail quite a lot as I’m not quick enough, but then I am back in guard which isn’t the worst thing . The thing I’m struggling with the moment is the X guard sweeps tend to land me in half guard top which feels more like a 50-50 position.

1618,"Very true story. I live in a developing country with a small but growing fight sports community but still a lot of leftover hocus pocus from yesteryear. Was in the middle of my Saturdaay morning calisthenics in the park and a fit looking middle age dude approached me. He said my lunges were similar to what he teaches. Uninterested but wanting to be polite I stupidly asked him to explain more. He told me to get back into the lunge (he called a modified horse stance). He then bumped me with his knee to ""offbalance"" me, and asked if I felt the ""ki"" energy coming from his center. Quickly cooling down and wanting to get back to my workout, I smiled and said that was really neat. No kidding, he then went on to ask me to put my hands on him and push. He did the circle arms thing and told me that he could anticipate my movements from the energy he felt. At this point I was getting frustrated b/c my old muscles were now cold and my workout was ruined. I let him go on for a bit more -- again trying to not be disrespectful to someone from my host country -- and he invited me to his weekly martial arts class in the same park. Don't worry there's no kumite, he said, so I wouldn't get injured. I just got on my bike and left -- never told him I'm a very real black belt in two very real martial arts.

1621,"The ""you"" here is directed to myself as this is an excerpt from my own journal. I'd love to hear your own insights and any feedback for my own. 

Training:

Show up everyday. You will still grow(or at least not regress) on days when you're not 100%. 

You're only as good as your teachers and  training partners can help you be. Pick the best ones you know. When you know better, pick better. 

The journey is a marathon, not a sprint. You will go farther as long as you keep walking. Pace yourself and avoid things that take you off the mats for too long. This can include training more than you want to and burning out. 

Good ego make you want to win and to learn how. Bad ego makes you avoid challenging yourself and losing. Know the difference and feed the right wolf. 

Learning:

Pursue consistent victory. Only make part of your A-game that which requires a specific reaction from them to defend. Don't depend on catching them with a move. Force them to make it to save themselves from a worse fate. 

A strong defence is the main highway of any A-game's road system. All transitions and attacks branch off it and may loop back to it. Make everything connected. The dead ends are your next goals.

Progression of learning: realize/get feedback/watch on film that you're doing something wrong, stop doing it live, learn/invent a way to do it right, drill till you reach a level of proficiency where it works live, apply it live against people of increasing difficulty, experiment/learn how to make it work, apply it live over and over to make it efficient, discover the underlying principle, apply in all facets of your game, teach it to others to force the unconscious to be consious.  

The Fight:

Only when they've spent all their energy and you've got some left in the tank, when all their attacks fail, your attacks are absolutely precise, do you win. Don't settle for anything less.  

If they feel you panic when they move a certain way, they will do it more. Hide it.

If you aren't precise with your attack, they will resist it hard. Mask it. 

They only way for them to not know when you will strike is if you don't know when you will strike either. 

Speed up and make space when defending, slow down and add pressure when attacking. 

You can rest after the match. Don't stop until it is done. 

Always except a dirty fight and all rules to be broken.

The opponent isn't real. Your battle is with the demons in your mind.",subs,bjj

Apologies for not being coherent. Might come back later and edit/ add..  
I'm 40. Physically very fit as compared to most other people my age who don't train. Also fitter than most of the BJJ guys.  
For the past 2 years I messed around with maybe 2 classes here and after a few months another class over there. It's only in the past few months I trained consistently for 2.5 months. Around 2-3 sessions / week. In that time I was also heavily into strength training and MY BODY WAS ACHING! Everything!  
Post a BJJ class I knew in was a Sympathetic state/ Fight-or-flight...  
Eventually I had to choose and again for the last 6 weeks dropped BJJ because I had some strength specific goals till end of year. Now that I'm picking up BJJ again..I'm literally scared right now. Don't know what that is...it's not specifically the fear of a lock or a choke. Maybe scared of the fatigue and then the body pain? If I had my way, I would drill and leave- no rolling. When I imagine that I feel much better.

I have a bit of an embarrassing problem that I'm hoping some of you might be able to help with.

&amp;#x200B;

So for the past few months I have been having good success using danahers single chest wrap and arm triangle series, you know finger walk/ratchet a single arm up towards the head, pass over then either smother or go for the arm triangle.

One of my team mates last session managed to get his other hand in the gap where my torso is  which kinda disrupts the whole motion. Its the arm that isnt really controller when you have the single chest wrap.

I haven't seen danaher cover this so looking for ideas to stop or counter this?

1670,"A question popped into my head after a potential confrontation at a parking lot. I used a technique called de-escalationato and walked away but had to think about how clueless people are as to how some people are armored up or how close they were from being f'd up. This begs the question for the higher belts...do yall walk away from a confrontation thinking I could have easily choked him out or broken him? Maybe the wording could be better.

Just to put this in a better context...today I motioned to a driver in front of me to take a parking space and then I continued talking to my wife. The passenger of this vehicle saw my hand gestures (no middle fingers) and thought I was bitching at them so he gets out of the car and starts charging at me. At this point, I have my wife in the passenger seat with two toddlers in the back of my SUV. I'm not fighting no dumbass on a concrete floor over a parking spot so I quickly de-escalated the situation before it got worse and out of hand. After hearing me, he apologized, shook my hand, and walked away. Maybe he saw my white belt and got scared.

But I walked away thinking how stupid his initial reaction was. Why would you charge at someone who is strapped with a conceal carry? But more importantly, why would you charge at anyone nowadays? I've sparred with dudes smaller and bigger than me to know that size doesn't matter. I'm just a white belt so it could have gone 50/50 but I know higher belts could easily have neutralized this dude.

Just a quick note to say that two really big events happened around this time that might shed some light. The invasion of Iraq and the war in Afghanistan. Americas biggest military endeavour in decades (at that time) which involved thousands of service personnel. Now, these two events started in 2001 and 2003, and veterans of conflict have a suicide rate four times that of the general population, so it doesn’t take a master statistician to extrapolate a correlation here…

I’m not American and it took me 2-seconds to figure out this is most likely the (or one of the) main reasons for this increase. Coupled with things like uncontrolled firearms sales and the fact that even in the 90s (though especially true of the early decades of thr 20th c) many suicides would not be categorized as such due to personal, social, and religious stigma (instead they would be categorized as “accidents” or “misadventures “)

1.  Being in someone’s deep DLR where it’s threaded through your legs really sucks. It’s a position that’s new to me, both offensively and defensively, and when it’s obtained it feels pretty “OP”. **Am I just a noob who’s missing something fundamental on defense here?** Prevention? It almost creates a dilemma between exposing your back and or getting swept easily. 

2. Sometimes, for various reasons, I end up in this flattened-out half butterfly guard (leg/shin in the crotch) and half closed guard (one leg free over their back). **How should I work from here?** My partner is now trying to pass and has weight on me, so freeing the butterfly leg to obtain closed guard is difficult—but so is pummeling the free leg in. 

3. When I’m playing open guard/sit up guard, it feels like there’s this constant trade off between me taking upper body grips and my opponent controlling my legs. Making it really difficult to set up points of control when my legs feel constantly pinned. (I know, classic leg pummeling drills) but in the Gi its still quite difficult when they have grips. **Should you be reaching for pant grips first, even when sitting on your butt?**

4. Some of the good fundamental attacks from closed guard require getting an elbow/arm across centerline. For any upper belt, the know to not let that happen. Even when I grab an opposite side tricep grip and a same side sleeve grip, raise the hips and attempt to force it, I’m really not able to set up much. **Is it a timing thing? Is there a better fake/set up to move the arm?**

I pretty much exclusively train in the Gi right now.

1722,"Before you read, just note that this was not an attempt at storytelling so much as making people laugh at a melodramatic rendition of two absolute shitters having a roll. Enjoy. Names have been changed but not by too much.

&amp;#x200B;

It had been a rough open mat session for the two grapplers. Christmas season was in full swing; as a result their fellow combat cubs had all stopped training to fulfill their family obligations. This open mat was filled with the sharks of the sea, those dreaded combatants: the Blue Belts. The poor fighting fledglings never stood a chance; round after round after round they fumbled about, desperately trying to escape as their godly counterparts simply sat there and let them squirm. But finally, none of their colour-belted counterparts had made eye contact, and made that dreaded motion of pointing back and forth to indicate a roll. Ajax pointed to a particularly empty area of the mat with hidden glee, still reliving the mount escape he managed to hit in a previous round. The only technique he had pulled off today.

Nick, looking down as to avoid any blue belt eye contact, accepted this offer. “Light or hard?” he asked, knowing full well it would just turn to hard within 30 seconds anyway if the former were selected. Consequently he didn’t even remember Ajax’s response. They made some boring small talk while the rest timer counted down. But talk of the sky was not what they were there for. They wanted to make the other see stars.

At last, the artificial sound of the bell coming from the instructor’s ancient iPad sounded, and then started the roll. The first two minutes of the six spent pummeling for double unders into body lock that never quite happened, finally the first real action occurred: a poorly-executed double leg shot from Nick! A sprawl, a further futile pushing of the double leg, a doomed attempt at a back take - a dance. Once all had been said and done, the pair ended up in half-guard, Nick’s guard of choice! 

A long-protracted battle of attempting to pass the half-guard commenced - Ajax trying to figure out a bunch of ways to get the dreaded legs off his own, and Nick holding on for dear life while creating sweep threats like rabbits create offspring. Another development occurred - one of the sweeps worked! After Ajax’s pitiful attempt at escaping side control resulted in an almost sad placing of the second knee by his other side, and now he had gone from top half-guard to bottom side-control.

In the humid Australian summer, the pair had begun to sweat profusely already. With Nick’s sweat dripping all over his face while he slowly but surely tried his way to full mount, Ajax began to wonder if BJJ was for him. While he considered this, an especially big perspiration piece plunged into his eye. But then he saw it, his final hope. Some call it space, others room. For Ajax, it was the light. The light between Nick’s legs.

A calm determination took over. He released the frame he had had across Nick’s hips, the only thing stopping him from doing exactly as he did - thrusting forward for high mount. This part required extreme precision and speed from Ajax. He turned his elbow and shoved it just in between Nick’s legs once his hips were in between Ajax’s chest and belly. He used this to pull himself out from under the mount. A more experienced combatant would have probably moderated the distance better and taken the back. Ajax was no experienced combatant. Instead he got up and back into his wrestling stance. Nick did the same. 1 minute left. Time to do it all again.

Tldr: Low quality roll between two white belts after getting fucked by blue belts the whole time.",subs,bjj

Happy holidays folks!

&amp;#x200B;

During the festivities I was trying to explain to some relatives why bjj is so darn addictive. I basically came up with a few (probably overlapping) ideas: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. You are constantly solving an ever-changing puzzle, against time (your opponent won't wait for you). This is why you may compare bjj to playing chess, although I'd rather compare it to bullet chess (you have to heavily rely on instinct and have to make split-second decisions). 
2. Although your conscious mind knows you are not in real danger, your subconscious mind does not, and it probably thinks your life is on the line.. This produces (I think) an adrenaline rush hard to find anywhere else, except extreme sports such as bungee jumps or similar..
3. Speaking of play-fighting, I think many animals, especially mammals, have evolved to like doing these kinds of activities (I picture cats, dogs, lions, goats, etc ). My guess is that with humans it's basically the same, although society has gone a step away from this direction.. but we are ""hardwired"" to like these activities. Further proof of this could be that most ancient cultures have some sort of martial art or fighting tradition.
4. The rabbit hole goes deeeeeep. You could spend a year (or more) just studying a particular position or submission. This may feel daunting for some people, but with the right mindset, this means you'll never run out of things to study or train..
5. It's really good physical exercise, which always feels good.
6. You get almost immediate, objective feedback. If you are into painting, you can spend a few weeks painting something, and then you only get opinions. If you learn a new armbar setup, you will or won't get the tap. And if you won't, you can analyze the reasons behind your failure, and try to fix it and try again.. and again.. and again.. until you get the tap or abandon the move. This creates a really unique feedback loop..

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, what are your thoughts on this? What makes bjj addictive for you (besides smashing lower belts 😂)?

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers!",subs,bjj
1726,"We're seeing no gi and yes gi specialists these days. However, there are still plenty of athletes who can do both.

Who do you think are the best in the world now if you combine their gi and no gi skills/accolades? I'm basing this more on accolades / wins than their potential.

My vote:

1. **Kaynan** \- Multiple ADCC Gold + Worlds Golds
2. **Nicholas Meregali** \- Silver Absolute ADCC  + World's Absolute 
3. **Mica Galvao** \- Silver ADCC + Gold World's
4. **Either Ruotolo Twin** \- I combined them because I didn't want to pick between either :-)  
5. **Mikey Musumeci** \- He hasn't competed in ADCC yet, but has beaten high-level people in no gi. Multiple Gi worlds. He could actually be number 1 skill wise but he hasn't proven himself enough in no gi. 

Others I've thought about:

• Felipe Pena. He has the accolades but severely underperformed during ADCC.  
• Tainan. Probably the best in the world now Gi wise, but we haven't seen him no gi.  
• Giancarlo Bodoni - Ridiculous performance at ADCC. I know he's comfortable in the Gi but we haven't seen him in the gi yet.",subs,bjj

1728,"(Check out my other recent posts about the other seminars)

&amp;#x200B;

\- So after seminar #2, we got up the next day to make the drive to Bon Aire, Ga to visit 3rd degree black belt, UFC veteran of a million fights, and former American Top Team teammate Cole Miller, who was hosting Marcelo for his third seminar.

&amp;#x200B;

Before we left, Marcelo insisted we take a picture with each other in front of my academy.  I'm so glad he did- because I had been so excited for him to visit my students and do a seminar, I had completely forgot- and it is now a picture I will always cherish. Which is ironic, because I always try to get a pic with us together (but that's more for social media and my students :)  And, when it really mattered- ie in front of my academy, I completely forgot!

&amp;#x200B;

Going to Georgia, was a 3.5 hour drive from my hometown of Gainesville, FL- but it flew by quickly as Marcelo and I had a lot to talk about...even though we are friends, ever since the 1st year of our friendship (in 2006/7), we have lived far apart from each other, so it's always awesome to catch up.  This is especially true now that he lives in Hawaii- although we still see each other about the same amount (3x a year or so), I seem to cherish the time a little bit more since we are physically located the furthest we have ever been.

&amp;#x200B;

We got to Georgia, and met up with Cole Miller.  This was the first time I have ever met him, but he was such a nice, welcoming person- and not only treated me to several meals, he treated me like a brother.  Throughout our two days together, it was apparent we were on different political spectrums (although we didn't talk about it- as I find it too boring to fruitless to debate on politics)- but it continued to remind me that Dems and Republicans can accept and treat each other with kindness and tolerance :)

&amp;#x200B;

Our first meal was at a sushi place - where we had a cute waitress.  But it became apparent that her dad also trained BJJ with Cole, so my flirting was off limits!  The conversation was awesome as Cole and Marcelo recounted their time spent training and fighting MMA.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Marcelo mentioned the time that Melvin Manhoef (youtube him- he's and amazing striker)- asked him to spar with him.  Marcelo figured he would get destroyed- but was pleasantly surprised when Melvin took an easy on him, and gave him pointers when they were sparring.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Marcelo had talked about how the fight game can be shady- as he was in a fight camp for 12 months, because they kept cancelling opponents at the last minute.  And, even though he was 0-1 in MMA, they had offered him both Mach Sakurai and Nick Diaz as opponents.  Interestingly, Marcelo excitedly agreed to both matches, only for the organization to cancel both at the last minute.

&amp;#x200B;

\- For his first fight, they had promised that he would be matched with someone of his same weight and experience- after 2 fighter cancellations, they matched him up with a 185 lbs who had a 10-3 record.  (Marcelo competes ADCC at 169- but I think his MMA weight class would have been 155 lbs).

&amp;#x200B;

\- During the fight, he suffered a kick to the head (or maybe knee?) - that had opened up a gash on his head that required over 100 stitches.  After the fight when he was in the hospital, he met long time fight veteran Carlos Newton, who had just gotten KO'd in the event.   Carlos insisted in looking at Marcelo's cut, and when Marcelo lifted up his bandage to show him- he was hoping Carlos would offer some wise words of comfort- instead, Carlos recoiled and said that was the worst cut he had ever seen in his mma career!

&amp;#x200B;

(Interestingly enough, I had been dog sitting at his apartment while this fight occurred in Korea.  Being that it took place 12 hours time difference, and in 2007, I was staying up late, on my laptop, constantly refreshing my page during Sherdog's live play by play.  In the first round, he had taken his opponent down and had his back, so I figured any moment after my screen refreshed, it would say he tapped him out.  When that didnt happen, and the fight got stopped on a cut, I automatically assumed it was a screwjob for the hometown fighter.   Back then, I was a huge Pride FC fan, and there had been a number of instances where it happened (Sakuraba fights).    When I asked him later if it was a bad call, he had mentioned that he was ready to keep fighting, but he was completed blinded by his blood...and the fact that it did take over 100 stitches to close the cut).

&amp;#x200B;

\- He did mention that during the fight, they had banned the use of vaseline, as the fight organization was still living down the huge controversy of a previous fight where Akiyama had defeated Sakuraba, but it was ruled a no contest as Sakuraba had complained that Akiyama was greased up for the fight and he couldnt be taken down.  Thus, without the vaseline, it was much easier to get cut, and much harder to stop any cuts as well.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The fight organization also knew Marcelo was a unique talent so they promised him a monthly training /living stipend- only to take it away after a couple of months-  I think this might have contributed to him opening up his Florida academy for a couple of years in Pembroke Pines.  So, at the height of his mma training- not only was he in a 12 month fight camp, he was also running a BJJ academy and teaching every night.

&amp;#x200B;

\- He trained with a lot of people at ATT- but some of his main training partners were Masvidal, Thiago Silva, and JT Calvalcante- all of whom were awesome to train with.  But there were other instances where people would try to ko him in training while training standup, since they would get so frustrated when they practiced the ground portion. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- The end of his MMA career came when after 12 months of hard training, and training really hard for Nick Diaz, they suddenly told him the fight would still take place, but he would lose 40% of his agreed upon purse, since the MMA organization (I think it was K1/Heroes btw) had just lost a huge sponsorship...it was at that point Marcelo figured he would just go back to his love BJJ.

&amp;#x200B;

\- He also mentioned that the 1 year of training MMA nonstop at American Top Team was so tough and rough on the body because he never turned down a round with anyone (as evidenced by him agreeing to spar with Melvin Manhoef lol), he grew increasingly concerned that all the training might break down his body eventually so he couldn't do bjj anymore in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

After a delicious meal and fun conversation, it was getting late and Cole has a belt promotion to do.  So we got back to our hotel rooms and rested up a bit- keep in mind, Marcelo' back was still very sore and he wanted it to be 100% for the seminar the next day.  

&amp;#x200B;

After a bit, we left to go to Cole's as Marcelo wanted to support his students at the promotions.   It was great to see a couple of his students get promoted- even 2 to black belt!  But, it was also awesome to see them get a nice surprise and have Marcelo attend their promotion :)

&amp;#x200B;

Afterwards, Cole graciously took us out to dinner again (the burgers were fantastic), and we got back to rest up for the next day....shooting guns at the range and seminar #3!",subs,bjj

I’ve essentially been recovering from this injury until today where I can say I don’t feel any more noticeable pain from my knee. Truthfully, I was very angry about getting injured. I’m a 36 year old guy with a family, career and small children I have to keep up with. Having a lagging injury when I have other responsibilities outside of class is not going to work. BJJ is just a hobby and I can’t risk any serious injuries. I tap early and tap often when the situation permits. I do everything in my power to minimize any risk of injury during training. 

The point I’m getting at is this… no more free work for spazzy white belts that don’t know how to roll. I’m just gonna crush these guys and dominate them in every roll. 

Am I wrong for thinking this way?",subs,bjj

1773,"Sup guys. Pretty new to BJJ and grappling. Long time Muay Thai. 

Went to a different gyms open matt last sunday. Guy had me flat basically, and he put his knee on my rib and it was hella pressure, I thought ""well, this is uncomfortable but surely I can just push through it"" nope, ended up making a grunt at some point which is when I think I injured the rib. 

It was not worth not tapping for. Would have been better to just tap and get put in the same position except with a game plan of how to get out. I do not fault the other guy because its 100% my fault for not tapping.

Anyways, its been about a week and its the weirdest energy that I've had so far.

Right after it happened, I went on to roll with 2 more people, and did pretty good against them. Didn't even think of the rib.

The next day I start noticing discomfort, I hit the gym anyway and run and jump rope, a lot. 

The day after that, it hurts to bend over, no chance of sneezing, etc. 

The day after that, the same as before except even more severe.

Then the following days up to today I noticed its leveled out and its just a bit tender, still painful getting out of bed, bending down, sneezing etc (I actually got a sneeze off yesterday).

To me it sounds like I tore the cartilage, which sucks since cartilage doesnt heal, so unless I get surgery this part of my body is going to be weak/prone to injury forever. 

Anyways I have a MMA fight on the 14th of janurary. Hope to heal up since then but it's been a week and its still pretty painful T.T",subs,bjj
1774,"Ola brothers and sisters. I did a search for this topic but didn’t really find a proper answer to my question. 

I’m early 40s, trained BJJ off and on for a few years and got myself up to blue belt. Due to a few niggling injuries, moving house and a change in job I gave it up about 5 years ago and haven’t donned the gi since. 

I’ve been doing kettlebell workouts and the odd boxing class for the last few years and I’m still in decent shape, but I can’t help but miss rolling. 

There’s a gym pretty near me and I’ve been thinking of starting again just for fitness and to feel that endorphin rush. But I need tips from some of the older rollers about how they maintain themselves while rolling with hungry young white belts. 

I should add I had a jits induced neck injury that flared up very regularly that meant I couldn’t turn my head for a couple of days. But I’m wondering if just tapping super early would compensate for that.

1777,"I'm a white belt who's been training for about a year and been learning programming/web development for the past 6 months. One of the projects I've been working on is a bjj scheduling app. Basically I want to allow coaches to make training sessions and allow students to view the schedule and receive push notifications (if desired). From this I can provide APIs so coaches can import the calender and other information to their website.

It seems most clubs I speak to use generic gym scheduling programs which lack things like a technique/position library (something I'm building). 

Some things I hope to include:
Affiliations (similar to smoothcomp)
Full library of techniques with ability to customize/write your own description for the session
Ability for students to check in at training using a qr code or similar (some countries get subsidies based on number of students attending, so I was told this could be useful)
If students are checking in at training, the ability to track and see what they've been focusing by technique name/category.
Breakdown of the sessions (time spent drilling/sparring/positional sparring etc.)

My biggest priority is ease of use. I think the process of adding and updating training sessions needs to be quick or people will not continue to use it.

I'm hoping to get some feedback from students and coaches on things they think could be useful and what current pain points are. I'm mostly doing this as a portfolio project at this point for my future job search, but if there is enough interest and I'm happy with the result, I may decide to launch it.

I also assumed that rolling light was when you went live but you took it easy and weren’t trying to kill each other, you could still get subs just as long as you were technical about it. Today I was rolling light with someone and I saw the opportunity for a rare substitute so I went for it and got it, my parter was very mad at me bc he said that you don’t submit people when rolling light.

1793,"I've  been training just over 4 years, and at this point I have solid  fundamentals, significant technical knowledge, and a go-to game plan  that I find a lot of success with.

I  have a hypothesis, which is that it would be beneficial for me to, for  the next 4-5 months, stop attending structured classes and only attend  open mats to roll and to workshop elements of my game that I personally  want to improve.

Between two gyms I have access to 5 open mat sessions throughout the week.

I  feel as if, at this point, I don't have all that much room to cram more  technical knowledge into my brain. Sometimes when rolling I try not to  think much and just do what feels right. Other times I make the  conscious decision to try to get to a specific position or submission  and make adjustments based on those successes and failures.

Once  I feel like I've solidified the things that I personally want to  improve about my game, then I will move back into regular classes. I  will have freed up some space for more technical knowledge, as other  concepts will have moved into unconscious memory.

I  feel as if this might be a great way to take control of my own  training. It feels difficult to do that in a standard class sometimes,  as the focus is generally on what coach is teaching that day, even if  its not a part of my own game.

Also, rolling is fun. So why not do it more?

From a mental health perspective, I just feel so much more grounded with a sense of clarity ,when I workout in a way that improves my movement and mobility. I focus on my breathing and meditate as well. 

I feel that if more people woked out to feel good, instead of to look good, we'd have a much healthier population than the image obsessed society we have now.

However, they do have a ton of killers on the mats + a lot of open mat sessions during the week. And the city I'm in has a ton of open mats around town.

1855,"It may be a generational thing or ""different local cultures"", but when class (not open mat) is scheduled for 6pm, I expect everyone on the mat ready to go at 6, and people (regardless of belt rank) are late at 601.  If people are late, ""punishment"" is a quick ten push ups then joining the appropriate group, and yes that applies to the purple belts who skip warmups and even brown/black belts.

To me, showing up on time is an essential part of respecting your training partners.  Their time is valuable, including the 5, 10, 20 minutes you weren't there to help them, and reshuffling groups to make sure people have appropriate training partners takes attention away from teaching and drilling.

It could also be the ""mma competition gym"" mindset.  A lot of younger fighters want the coaches to schedule them fights, and the expectation is that the fighter is showing up to class on time, a certain number of times per week, otherwise a different fighter should get that opportunity to compete.

This isn't to say that being late is inexcusable or that people should be publicly shamed for being late.  Traffic is real, kids class ends 5 minutes before adult class begins, etc.  But a quick ""yes I'm late, I did my push-ups, can I join?"" Two minutes after class starts is way less annoying than a white belt skipping all of drilling and just showing up to roll.",subs,bjj

1871,We had promotions tonight and people that started way after me got their blues. Didn’t bother me at all and I was genuinely happy for them. My coach pulled me aside after class and said that it could have been me if I tried harder and cared more. I don’t care. It’s just a belt and this is just a hobby for me. I’ve competed 6 times a year for past 2 years and that’s when I give 100% not when I’m learning new stuff on the mat. I would rather flow roll for a round than constantly hitting subs and restarting. Just not sure if maybe I’m looking at this all wrong and I’m disgracing a martial art that I’ve learned to love. I know what my coach thinks but I’m fine just having fun as a white belt forever.

1882,"I feel like my days of playing bottom and being comfortable in half guard is over since everyone knows what I’m doing and immediately disabling me from moving forward from half guard to closed guard/ dog fight or attempting to go deep half for some simple straight ankle or knee bar.

I know I should focus on wrestling and getting the person on the bottom from the beginning but say if we scrambled and etc to the point I’m back in half guard, I just subconsciously stay there and play my usual game which I think I shouldn’t be too reliant. Also my coach does give me hints but he also says try to get comfortable and get better at both the good and bad positions, which isn’t much help. This sounds pretty dumb but despite having training partners to try out moves after class or on days where there’s no class, I have a lack of imagination and rely on something to give me an idea ie videos and demonstrations.

Does anyone know any material or bjj fanatic videos where they emphasise wrestling or scrambling their way from bottom (bad or an okay position).",subs,bjj

1886,"Im tagging this as a shit post because Im full of shit myself, but its kind of serious.  I started following here at the same time I started going to my local gym, and have been really entertained and felt like this is a place to ask.

So i got laid off work and have a lot of time on my hands, and decided to join the local bjj/grappling gym in hopes of ultimately getting my two young daughters into it.  Theyre schedule is 2 nights gi, 2 nights no-gi, and 1 open mat/sparring night.  Ive been going 5 nights a week for the last 3 weeks because im bored and enjoying it, and plan to continue and commit for atleast a year.

Im 37, 5'6 and stay within 5lbs of 150. Most people think im about  25. I have never done any combat sports/wrestling/etc.  The only sport I ever played was baseball and that stopped at 13.  Im a pretty solid 150lbs after going on a health kick a couple years ago, and have been full body stretching daily for longer than that, so im in fairly good shape and quite flexible.  I do have a torn PCL in my left knee thats been like that for 15 years.

More to the point - how can I be a better roller or partner? In this gym it seems im by far the person with the least experience in general, by a couple years. At the same time, i can actually move really well through a lot of this stuff, atleast in the drills.  Its a concept of movement, right? And while I never wrestled or trained anything, i did grow up in an isolated area and grew up fighting a lot.  Being smaller, i just naturally kind of learned to get a fight on the ground and get on top or behind someone, and a lot of guys here i think i have wrestled because of that and i apparently have solid grips on things when i get ahold.  I dont know what im doing, but i can pretty effectively hang on to someone for a while if i want to.  But i dont think that helps me or my partner at all.  I dont know really know any chokes or submissions and im never really even thinking about pulling one off, but I *can* restrain someone or keep them down, if that makes sense?  These are all white and blue belts im rolling with, i believe - if i get someone pretty well locked up and restrained, would it be better for us both if i ""let go"" so we can keep things going?

 This question stems from my previous one - Ive read here about ""spazzy white belts"" and im wondering what exactly that means?  My first open sparring night, i was told i did a good job.  One dude even made it a point to tell people not to let me get their neck, because i wont let go (?).  Afterward i was talking to him and he said i had good instincts and energy, but i was going at it ""like a fight"".  Mentally, im not feeling aggressive at all, but i suppose physically i am definitely exerting myself.  At the same time, the guys im rolling with these nights outweigh me by 50-70lbs, so I almost feel like i have to - but i suppose thats because im not skilled yet?  So is ""fight mode"" the spazzy white belt thing?  Ever since i was told that, ive tried to take my foot off the gas when im rolling, and not exert myself as much. But at the same time, i personally dont have a problem getting handled and a little roughed up in the learning process, and also feel like i learn this better at a faster pace, ""blurring"" the motions together, than slow easy drilling of it.  A faster pace, not necessarily a harder one.  But i know faster can lead to accidents which can lead to harder for some people (i ended up with a nice bruise on my throat from a dude.)  So how should i read a partner with this?

Another spazzy white belt thing - what kind of things should i should?  Im consciously trying to never grab at peoples fingers, and avoid their face and dick.  At the same time - can you just lay a forearm across someones neck from top mount (?) if you have the opportunity? Can you pretty much throw and trip people around as long as you dont try and slam them or do WWF shit? Like, am I pretty well free to move around however I want to get the position i want?

Is all of this ultimately just ways to either take and hold a dominant position for points (im still reading up on rules), or submit people?  A submissions are basically just finding novel ways to choke people with their shirt, your body, or even their own body? Or grab a limb or joint and contort it in an uncomfortable way to make them say ""uncle""?  Like I dont need to necessarily know the name of whatever I am doing or it even have a name as long as it makes them submit. (Ive had 3 guys tell me Ive almost had them in a guillotine, but i was doing it wrong so it was just hurting rather than choking and they sidnt tap.  Id prefer to not just inflict pain on my partners.)

Sorry this is so long.  This is actually the shorter version.  Regardless im going to keep at this, because its fun and way more practical exercise.  And one final question, that Ive wondered since I first got on the mat -

 Is this ultimately just one big game of gay chicken?",subs,bjj

1902,"It's a long story, I write it down in order to feel better about it, even if more than a year has passed and I've already gone through that, yet it seems I can't go back to BJJ (I'm also lazy). I'm quite ashamed about this, I'm not looking for your sympathy nor pity, nor the contrary. I don't need motivation, but I'm glad to share this with you all, and also hear your personal stories if you have similar ones.

More than one year ago, due to bad work scheduling, I couldn't go to class frequently and I was often in bad physical shape, no cardio and so on. Yet as a purple belt I was often regarded from my coach as ""his pupil"" or generally being looked upon as the most technical one on the mat. That had always been like that for years, to the point I started feeling the weight of this 'responsibility', and you all know what that means when you start rolling and it's always intense and the other guy is always trying ""to go for it"" even if it was supposed to be a flow one. 

We're a very ""rough"" school to say the least, they're all good and respectful guys at the end of the day, but you know that ""alpha"", competitive atmosphere. Anyway, what I said above was also continuously enforced by my coach, to the point that one night, rolling time, he jokes out loud something to a white belt ""if you tap him you'll get a blue belt"". This bigger guy, MMA fighter, but still a white belt with stripes in BJJ, gets all pumped up and we start rolling. 

Now, I gave many excuses to myself to what happened, lack of cardio, concentration, I had another guy's oversized gi jacket on, and so on, but that was it. We start rolling, at one point I pull guard (yes I'm a guard puller, don't hate), he gets my oversized gi jacket and caughts me in some sort of lapel choke (coach had just taught that technique that night, even more shamefully), I tap. 

The guy gets up screaming, starts running around the gym celebrating, I sit there, everyone's looking at me in a mix of shock and disbelief. My coach just have a laughter with the guys and he gives him his promised blue belt. 

It wasn't even a cardio tap, it was a mere technical one, and from there I started questioning my own purple belt and my jiu jitsu. 

I've never gone back to the gym since that day, I miss BJJ, this should be a lesson for my ego, and I learned that. I'd go back with a blue belt for I don't feel I deserve mine, yet I know I'm better than that single rolling, and I'm better than a purple belt that gets tapped by a white belt. Maybe it shouldn't matter that much, but you all know it does. 

One day I know I'll be back, but for now I just needed to share this with many other people, I used to joke about this with my friends, but on the internet is always a bit more 'exciting' and unpredictable. If you wish to share your stories, leave a comment or whatever you feel like, I'll read that with pleasure. Thanks for your time if you've read all this post, wish you a nice day!",subs,bjj
1903,"Not bragging, just received a new appreciation for the sport after promotion.

That being said, it gave me a huge appreciation for upper belts.  It showed me how much hard work y'all put in and even though a purple,brown,black belt is so far away... I'm so excited for the journey getting there and having the dynamic with my gym that all of the upper belts have.

1923,"BJJ practitioner will often train in full sleave rash guard and spats; skintight clothing, akin to spandex allowing for pressure comfort without hindering ease of movement or aesthetics. 

A common argument is that this attire holds a hygienic advantage in that higher % skin coverage will equal lower probability of contagious skin infections like staph or ringworm.

My post is to argue that the reverse of this is true. 

A common counterargument is that preventing skin infections is not related to lowering skin-on-skin contact, but more about overall health and self-care; good diet, sleep, and washing promptly after training. Without the relevant expertise, I am agnostic on this point, although I would of course advocate appropriate self-care. Particularly appropriate washing and grooming before and after class – specifically I tend to recommend Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport Body Wash prior to rolling.

My argument against full rash-guard-spats is that by displaying the maximum amount of your skin on the mat, you allow a higher amount of scrutiny and accountability from your training partners regarding your skin condition. Think about this: imagine your goal is to avoid skin-infection and you must decide between rolling with two men, one is entirely covered in synthetic fibre, the other wears nothing but a tight pair of vale-tudo shorts, you can see almost his entire body, his shoulders, his chest, his abdomen, his tight and muscular quads as they transition into his bountiful gluts. You can take almost the entirety of his flesh before deciding at which point, you’re naturally going to pick the 20-year-old.

Think also of the deterrence that dressing like this will have on anyone tempted to attend training when there are possible issues. Imagine walking onto the mat, everyone stops and stares as you enter as you’ve running 10 minutes late. The Professor eyes you with energetic disapproval. You’re dressed only in the blue trunks that Dennis Hallman wore to fight Bryan Ebersole. They set upon you.",subs,bjj

I am a white belt living and training in Prague, Czech Republic. Within my short, but intense BJJ journey I have discovered how inspirational visiting other clubs and cities can be - as I always enjoyed meeting people and cultures!

Due to that, I want to start a blog, where I will be introducing the different European cities (maybe I will be able to expand in the future- who knows - but for now I keep it realistic), but through the eyes of the local BJJ practitioners.   


Blog won't be about me, I will only host it. Initially I want to tell the story about:  


a) Clubs - their history, what they value, what is their training regime and what are the fav techniques.  
This part will most likely include the interview with club owner and footage from the class (warmup, 1-2 techniques, sparrings etc)  


b) City where the club is located - the interesting facts, where to stay when travelling on budget, what to eat, interesting spots / local initiatives -  those will come from the from the coaches and club members - there's so much diversity among us, no need to look for inspiration elsewhere!

c) Last but not least - the beautiful BJJ community people, what they do, what are their passions outside of BJJ - for example in developing their communities, being artists, helping charity or being successful also in other fields (this is the element I hope to be surprised with the most!).  


I am asking here, because I would like to know if that's something that you would take a look at?  


Also, I would love to hear some stories from your cities,clubs recommendations or maybe to hear stories about your local heroes or simply something interesting, you consider worth mentioning!

I have made it my mission for the past 6 months to get better at half guard passing, courtasy of Gordon Ryans Half Guard Passing instructional.

I have been doing quite well with it but experiancing a rather annoying problem.

 Whether I manage to pass the top knee or just in a knee shield , one of my training partners has gotten good at controlling my left hand at the wrist which would be the one I would use to get the crossface. It throws me off my game as I know that if he connects his second hand he has a kimura so he has been using this well to not let me settle into my half guard passing game.

I cant find reference anywhere to this in Gordons instructional , so wondering if anyone can offer some advice on here?

I made some really good friends with the students and the coaches there and at the time I would definitely say that most of my best friends were at the gym. But when I was around 17 i started to go through a rough patch and kind of burnt out on BJJ, I also ended up hurting my neck pretty bad due to someone fucking up Judo throw. This lead to me taking a break from BJJ and canceling my membership at the gym. The only thing is that I didn’t tell anyone what happened or what was going on so it looked like I just randomly left the gym. My old coaches would even text me asking me when I was coming back but I never responded. I took that whole summer off and eventually went to a new gym closer to my home. I feel bad because I was really good friends with everyone in that gym and I want to reconnect, I would love to make friends again and be able to cross train with them every once in a while.

I have been working alot on my back attacks lately since it was/is a huge gap in my game. When I run in to issues I mostly just look up answer (SUBMETA is great for this and I am a member) but I have been running in to this one super annoying counter and I cant find a good answer nowhere.

Situation: You force turtle from any position, lets say side control here. You are going for a seat belt and working one hook in (nearside). The opponent takes the top arm of the seatbelt and pulls you to the mat. Your mobility to attack is dead there is no way to establish hooks once they are out. You get pulled down your shoulder is stuck to the mat, you have to settle for bottom half guard basically. If the guys is bigger the you he can even pop his hips up and you get thrown over.  Yes you still have his arm crossed which is good but you lost the back.

I brushed off that insult -maybe he’s just on the spectrum, I figure, and tbh I have a touch of aspy’s myself- and we rolled.  Then after I played my usual half-guard game, swept him and tapped him with a scarf hold Americans he actually started crying on the mat.

So i've been trying so hard to get better at maintaining the back but im struggling- im 5ft 5 and around 65kg. Mount is my game but holding and finishing from the back is a bit of a weak point for me. 

Whenever I try to use two hooks, opponents bigger than me easier stuff the hook and escape then I have to try the whole process again. I struggle with using back triangles due to leg length.

However when I lock a half back position or as its sometimes referred to by Gordon- a high ball ride- I find that I can hold people in this position much easier and for longer periods. 

Does anyone have any resource or input as to whether this is a viable route to getting better at back control for someone shorter? I haven't seen much online about it, as most people look to throw in the second hook whenever they can or lock up a triangle.

2013,"Hey r/bjj, one of my first Gis was a Mundial 9 made by Atama. It has lasted incredibly well over the years and is by far my most favourite Gi. I really like the materials, quality, fit and that it doesn't stretch when pulled. Although it is usually described as very heavy, it feels light (even when soaked) and I feel agile and quick in it. I also like Atamas Ripstop pants the best. 

However, I cannot find the Mundial 9 anywhere anymore. I wouldn't care if I need to order from Brazil, the US or Europe, it just seems unavailable everywhere (needing size A2 probably doesn't help either)

Therefore I would like to ask which Gis (which are hopefully currently available somewhere) are similar to the Mundial 9 in terms of material/weave and sizing/cut. Considering how fond many people are of the Atama Gis I can imagine others have been in a similar place already

The Internet has been a part of my martial arts journey from almost the beginning. long before I started, BJJ, I was a troll, and then an admin at Bullshido. Strangely enough, I used to be the striking mod. Years of Muay Thai and Shidokan knockdown karate led me to understand that the only future for a short brawler was CTE and a crooked nose. 

So shortly after I got married with my wife’s support, I set off to find a martial art that was less damaging to my face. I obviously knew about BJJ and was interested in grappling from learning Judo Newaza and wrestling decades ago. I a strange twist of luck, and I was unwilling to go to most of the local BJJ schools. I had fought against or cornered against their fighters for years previous. 

This led me to a school slightly farther away called Paul Creighton, mixed martial arts. Little did I know at the time Paul was a Renzo Gracie, black belt, and one of John Danaher’s early training partners. I instantly fell in love with BJJ and this group of guys. Paul’s environment was super positive while also being incredibly committed to technical BJJ in and out of the Gi. 

Two kids later I was a purple belt not training as often as I wanted to. Partially because of the distance so I moved to a closer school with Sam Joseph who I had met through Paul. Sam taught a different kind of BJJ with heavy pressure and grip fighting that I had largely ignored due to my preference for no-Gi and gimmicks. 

There I earned my Brown belt and continued training but with a job in IT and two kids and a smattering of injuries I wasn’t as consistent as I wanted to be. 

In 2018 I thought my journey had ended. I pinched nerves in my neck and lost feeling in my right arm. My arm began to atrophy and I was told I’d never train again. Luckily I live in a city with great medical care and found an orthopedist and neurologist willing to help me. I got back on the
mats 9mo-1year later and was just getting back in shape when COVID happened. 

I took the lockdown very seriously and didn’t train for almost a year. When I came back I really felt like I had lost ground against folks who only took the mandatory month off. I was also starting to really miss no-Gi which had mostly dried up during COVID. 

That’s when I changed schools again and joined Helix BJJ, taught by Justin Parsons. Justin is a black belt who I had trained with years before when I first started. He was my first BJJ idol because he gave everyone that feeling of having you ass kicked very gently and in slow motion. I figured if I could learn that I’d really understand BJJ. 

Finally last night Justin awarded me my Black Belt in BJJ and I couldn’t be happier. I still feel like I’m learning and have no plans to stop!

8. Focus on being less wrecked than your opponent at da end of a match

9. Wicked instructors have a method to their madness. Just coz yous can’t check it, doesn’t mean its not there. How do yous know if a instructor is good? Check at is students and their accomplishments.

If there is any advice anyone can give me, with tips or things I can do, so more experienced students who get stuck with me get something out of the class, I’d love to hear them. I think it’s important to note that I’m not only less experienced, but I am very new. I literally almost know nothing. 

I understand some people learn by teaching, so it helps some of the experienced students to guide less experienced students… but that’s not the case for everyone…. So how can I be a good, less experienced, partner to work with? What can I do to help make the class worth their time, so they aren’t getting ripped off by being stuck with me?",subs,bjj
2080,"So I’ve been in the jujitsu game for a while now on and off in the beginning but now I’m more into it as far as time and dedication. The point is, after all these years of training I recently started training with a high level black belt and this guy has a squeeze like no other I’ve ever felt and it’s so discouraging as much as it is inspiring (for lack of a better word). And I just want to know how can I obtain this type of squeeze? It’s like as soon as he mounts me it’s over, I try to use my technique when he has the head and arm in and I fight it off for a few breathes and then it’s over.

2084,"To set the scene, I've been involved with BJJ for over a decade. I have trained, compete and refereed in several countries. Though I have won many competitions, including some IBJJFs, I am a far cry from a world champion. However, I have devoted a lot of time and energy to my own development by going to seminars and studying DVDs. That being said, at this point, I am seldom challenged by anyone unless it's a name we all know (thankfully, I have access to some of the top gyms in the US by paying for day passes in my area).

I received my brown belt give years ago in 2017. I worked really hard for this thing, obtaining it within five years. However, the coach and I fell out because I am not a sycophant. I just wanted to pay and practice jiu jitsu as I saw it, and not want to do only his techniques. Furthermore, some of the parents (of his kids students) even wanted to do privates with me because they saw what I did in the training room. This is despite my never being a formal instructor there. Between my love of modern technique and requests for privates, I was kicked out. This head coach swiftly blocked me from his social media and has not said a word to me at numerous competitions.

Fast forward to now, where I've spent another five years at Brown Belt. When I initially joined this gym, I knew the instructor personally. He was a friend of a friend, who was also a brown belt. He said that he needed the room to be built and offered me a spot to train for free. I even went on to coach some classes, and only gave that up once my work schedule began to conflict. A year ago, he was granted his black belt.

Six months ago, he sat me down and asked what my personal plans and goals were. The gym was moving locations and he said he wanted to know if I could still be a part of all of this. He has connections and asked if I wanted my black belt from him sooner or if I wanted help getting recognition from a prestigious black belt. I expressed that my time in this area would be short; my wife and I plan on moving away and starting a family in about 2 years. I said that I wanted a black belt from him, my friend and mentor, and not from someone I did not know. I went on to win numerous IBJJFs between then and now, thinking that I could close out this competition season with a cherry on top...

Needless to say, I did not receive a black belt at least week's promotions. He said he did not give me the belt because he wanted it to be recognized by the IBJJF, but that his coach was unwilling to sign for someone he never met. This isn't something I cared for since I am done with competition. I just wanted my own coach to do it. Furthermore, he asked me to cover this week's classes on a day's notice.

Am I being taken advantage of? Am I just a sucker for being manipulated? I am contemplating leaving this gym because of this heartache. I don't feel respected or heard as a friend or student here. The reality that I might leave this town with over a decade of training and without a black belt is weighing heavy on my heart. Distraught is not a big enough word.

Or should I just shut up and keep training? It's not about the belts, after all...

tl;dr: coach didn't give me a black belt after a candid discussion and a lot of effort put into earning one. What should I do?",subs,bjj

We don’t really train any leg locks at my gym, and we mainly train in the gi. Have i let that stop me? Not even a little bit.  On white belts i use my leg lock entries, not to secure locks, because we’re not allowed to or whatever, but to sweep, on blue belts i usually only use them for straight ankles unless me i know the blue belt is happy to play in the space with me, and on any belt above blue i’m looking for toe holds mostly but some black belts i’ll play the toe hold into the knee bar, or i’ll hunt for a heel, but for the most part i’m just looking for straight ankles since that’s what i’m allowed to do.

He immediately blast doubled her and she hit the mat hard. She shrimped and stood up again. He then got 2 under hooks in and front suplex her. I could tell it was very painful but anyway she got out of it and stood up again. Then he did a standing guillotine choke on her. She barely had time to tap and then the coach got furious. He shouted at the wrestler to roll with him. The coach tossed him around like a rag doll multiple times, then submitted him with an Ezekiel choke. The wrestler was drenched in sweat. The coach then said “Is this how you want to roll 100% the time? Because if you do, only roll with me and not with her again”.

2204,"Hear me out. I've been training for 6ish years. Historically, I usually attack my opponent's left arm. I play half guard on my right hip, and it's there. From turtle, I always seem to attack the left arm. From back, the same. From side control, the far side arm bar is most often the left arm. 

But not only do I do this to others, others do this to me. I feel like my left arm gets attacked far more than my right. Have others experienced this phenomena? Is this indicative of a common training bias towards one side versus the other? Is it reflective of the majority of people being right-handed, and thus developing a preference for playing against the opposing side? Or is it because we natively assume that our opponents will be right-handed, and thus their left should be weaker?

Now the hypothesis. I propose that this preference for attacking (and thus defending) the left arm is widespread among the bjj community, at all belt levels. This preference has therefore led to the left arm of all seasoned bjj practictioners being disproportionally stronger than the right, particularly with gripping and holding-fast type motions.

2219,"I finally saw a hit job in my BJJ class tonight. I've heard rumors of these things happening. When the instructors tells one of his top students to smash a low level. I've seen soo many YouTube videos of these things but never really witnessed it in person. It was glorious.

This white belt, who has some training, was rolling with another white belt. He was rolling with a newbie female white belt that was very vanilla. Zero training, out of shape, and just barely grasping the first couple of moves in BJJ. 

The guy was just smashing her every chance he got. For me, as a newbie, I thought it was excessive, and just rude as hell. Because you can see that the guy was just trying to win like he was hoping the professor was going to give him a black belt on the spot.

I was taking a break sitting next to my professor and one of the top belts that competes regularly. We were all watching this and she was getting so smashed she left in the middle of class after that role. They took a break for water and my professor whispered in his top students ear while looking at the guy who just smashed the hell out of the woman. I've finally seen it! I don't think I've ever been so satisfied to see this in person especially seeing how that guy treated the female white belt. 

Let's just say the ""hit job"" was executed. I can see why these things are necessary. Essentially it humbled the dude and calmed him down. But I'm not sure how he will carry on next time when he rolls with another low level. Let's just hope he rolls better with someone less experience. If not, I guess someone will eventually put him in his place, again.

Has anyone else have these stories? Are these successful ways to protect low level belts from being hurt and discouraged? What suggestions do you have? I've realized early in my journey that smashing people not as skilled as you, at the white belt level, is just being a prick and helps no one at the end of the day.

Decided to make a change. I do liquids until dinner now. Usually a Premier protein shake around 11 am go hold me over till dinner. And I do my beast not to go crazy at dinner. It's hard because I'm so hungry and most of the time I've trained right before. So I'm *hungry*. But I'm also eating healthier now. So that helps. 

Idk what the whole poit thing of this post is exactly. But I love JiuJitsu, my gym, my gym mates. And (to a lesser extent) this sub. So to any over weight practitioners, you *can* loose that weight. And I know this because I'm currently doing it. 

Thanks guys.

Both groups have students that come 2-3 times a week and those that come 4+ times a week, but it always seems that beginners/hobbyists get graded faster. I've heard the coach say privately to higher belts that they grade people who are beginners/hobbyists faster (to get them to progress out of the beginner's classes and into the advanced classes) than those who compete and win. Just wanted to know if this was a common thing in gyms; to separate the hobbyists from competitors at grading, and if progressing people differently depending on if they compete or not was common.

2248,"I recently moved countries for work to a small town in the US and quickly signed up at an academy that I had already tried on a preview trip before deciding to move here. I enjoy the instruction and everyone's very nice. The thing is, in the month I've been here we haven't done any live rolls at all. There have been a couple of positional rounds and the only real sparring I've done has been at open mats or at times I stay after class (which I can't really do much of because I have to get to work an hour after). I asked the coach why rolling wasn't bult into the classes (like at every other school I've been at), and he told me it was about protecting people from doing techniques they haven't really grasped and reducing injury. I'm really frustrated about it, to say the least, because I paid what to me is an expensive enrollment fee, which I guess is my fault for not considering to ask if they rolled or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I visited the only other gym in town, and it's on the other end of the spectrum, hard rolls and nothing else, which I'm fine with. The thing is, it's very, very dirty. The mat has hair and dust all over, the floor surrounding it has all kinds of grimy stuff, the coach himself steps on the mat with sneakers, the students use loaner gis that evidently haven't been washed, and I saw a couple of guys, including the coach rolling with ringworm. I know it's not patty cake, but it really worries me to roll in this environment, plus my wife happened to drop me off there last time I visited and she was very against me going there, getting an infection and pass it onto her or something.

2255,"So at my latest session, we drilled a rear naked choke from the back position. We get to sparring and there's this dude who I partner up with who's the highest rank at the gym (3-stripe white belt), I have no stripes and I just began like 3 months ago.

I take his back with my hooks around his waist and we go. I'm expecting a light roll as I'm new-ish but he does this weird thing with his feet that puts a lot of pressure on my ankles to attempt to get rid of my hooks but it doesn't work. It felt like he was trying to dislocate my ankles, it is also not what we drilled to escape the rear naked choke. After him holding that for 15 seconds he realizes it doesn't work but gets out another way and after rolling at full intensity for a minute he gets the mount on me and we have to reset.

After we reset he looks at me confused and asked if that had hurt me and it wasn't in a concerned way but in a ""How did that not hurt"" kind of way. I'm no expert at BJJ but the move he did on me felt illegal and I'm not sure if he knew that what he was doing could seriously hurt someone. I told him it hurt a little bit but the truth was it hurt like a mofo and was quite sore in my ankles after it, truth is if he was a little stronger I think he could have dislocated my ankles. I also thought it was weird that he asked me if it had hurt when I showed no sign of pain while he was doing it.

So I sat out and watched this dude roll with other people and I could tell this was one of those guys that had to win every roll during sparring at all costs. So we partner up again with me taking his back with the intention that I was going to match this guy's intensity. I held my hooks around his waist and didn't try to go for the rare naked choke straight way but I wanted to see if he could get my hooks. So after a few attempts of trying to get out he tries to do that ankle bullshit on me again. I'm a lot bigger than this guy and pretty sure stronger as I used to power lift competitively and work in trades. In everything I do I try to prioritize technique rather than strength but I was pissed so I'm like fuck this guy and don't bother with the rear naked choke and just use my strength to do a neck crank with his chin tucked but very slowly (not sure if illegal). I hear him wheeze and he taps instantly and walks off without fist-bumping or acknowledging me at all. His ego was clearly hurt but I wanted to teach him a lesson. Everyone else I rolled with I was chill with.

Looking back on my 1st fight which took place in march, I absolutely ate shit. I wasn’t prepared enough and thought signing up in the welterweight class was going to be just fine so I didn‘t have to cut.

I was very nervous almost made sick so I stepped on the mat and thought I‘m going to do well all until the fight started.

He pulled the guard and somehow i landed in his triangle and he armbared me. The fight was over after 20 seconds. I was destroyed mentally and didn’t sign up for a competition for the next 6 monthts.


Looking now to my 2nd fight i prepared myself much better by and signed up for lightweight. I was confident this time.

My only hesitation is that I might struggle to find local competitions if I’m not part of an mma gym unless I compete in single disciplines, and that either gym could look down on me training less often as I’m at the other gym half the time. I also have the options of driving to a decent mma facility but the long travel might mean I train less frequently. Or joining just one gym first and then another later if I feel the need to.

**Q.  Can I read any book of Ishihara after brain mapping?**

A. Yes, you can read any Ishihara book printed anywhere in the word.

**Q. Why Ishihara defer one from another?**

A. Ishihara is printed by different printers and saturation of colours differ in printing, hence some books look easy to read and some hard.

**Q.  Can I trace paths or line also?**

A. Yes, you can trace lines and paths with colour differentiation system with mind mapping.

**Q How many days it takes to read Ishihara?**

A. It takes only 1 or 2 days but practice is required for speed and accuracy.

**Q How many days it takes to read Ishihara without error?**

**A.  It takes normally 15 to 20 days depending on the intensity of one’s colour blindness.**

**Q  Can I read Ishihara only one time or it is for life?**

**A. You can read Ishihara in your life anytime.**

**Q  What is brain mapping?**

**A. it is just like recognizing a person from backside without looking ones’ face.**

**Q.  How many colours are in Ishihara?**

**A. There are only 2 colours in Ishihara plates and other colours you see are of different saturation.**

**Q. Why I am unable to read Ishihara?**

**A. When 2 colours of same intensity come closer; they create an illusion in your eyes to differentiate.**

**Q.  How can I differentiate colours to read Ishihara?**

**A. You can differentiate colours through brain mapping ie to see again and again.**

**Q. Can I live a normal life with colour blindness?**

**A. Actually, you are already living normal life except correct naming of colours.**

**Q. Does this system works on visual aids like TV, projector etc.?**

A. Yes, this system works on a projector, monitor, TV, Laptop, computer and other visual aids.

**Q. How long this brain system works?** 

**A. Brain Mapping system works whole life and does not require retraining. Only revision at a certain interval is necessary to refresh mapped images.**

2312,"So I can go to the advanced class get smashed and be someone's training dummy, sure I'm getting better  but how fun is that?

Or I can hang out at the fundamentals class with mostly white belts ,seek out white belts at open mat /all levels classes dominate them, all while getting the opportunity to choose how the rolls go. I can try new moves, new submissions, escapes etc don't get to do that if I spend all my rolls under a brown belt's mount.

I know Roger Gracie and Craig Jones trained with lower levels people when they were coming up and still improved and still got to a world class level. So is needing to get smashed , "" learning to lose"" a adage that doesn't make sense?

So wouldn't a better strategy be to target white belts/those worse than you exclusively until you're high level, then open up to everyone else?

Tried this a bit at open mat on Friday, working slx/x guard sequences I can't pull of on other blue belts or up and want to develop, flowing through positions, submissions at will, or vs a purple belt who smashes me while refining their own game, seems like a no brainer?",subs,bjj

2333,"Recently made the switch to a new gym in town, among several reasons I chose to do so the biggest reason was because they offered childcare during classes. I’m sure many of us have experience with kids disturbing class and being wild, I’ve even had mine run on to the mats mid drill the two times I tried to bring them previously. Most of the time it’s not their fault or their parents, kids just do kid shit especially around other kids. It adds a ton of stress trying to focus on rolling while trying to keep an eye on your kids at the same time. 

Not being limited to relying on a babysitter at home or a significant others work schedule being conducive (in my case) has allowed me to already attend more classes than I ever have before.

2356,"Long ass story, so I'll just cliff notes it:

- Begin training BJJ in 2016
* Find out I have really bad arthritis, degenerative discs, herniation and even stenosis in my cervical spine
* New Instructor at the Dojo takes over and I really do not like him
* Take a break from BJJ and focus on strength training
 

- Start training seriously in 2018
* Tear the meniscus in both knees within 3 months of each other and 6 months training
* Pinched nerves in my neck causes constant pain after a lot of neck work
* Take a break from BJJ and work on my knees / neck
 

- Return to training 2019
* Knee's are bad and I have to work around it, but it's manageable
* Break two toes from a take down (taped it and kept going lol, not a big deal)
* Develop arthritis in my shoulder and start to have range of motion loss after a hard take down
* Take a break from BJJ
 

- Return to training 2020
* Knee's are still rough but manageable
* Shoulder is okay, but still sensitive
* Neck is still sensitive but okay
* Start to experience fainting during really hard rolls
* Both shoulders now have confirmed severe arthritis and are experiencing range of motion loss
* Lower back starts to become very stiff
* Take another break and attempt to get my medical stuff sorted
 

- Discovery from Medical 2021
* Both knee's have torn meniscus, arthritis, and wear and tear (Get surgery on one, rehab both, both are doing a lot better)
* Both shoulders have a lot of arthritis, and minor labrum damage (Surgeon recommends anti-inflammatories and to return if it persists)
* Fainting is due to Vasovagal syncope (My body thinks we're in a constant fight and it's putting me to sleep to rest / recover)
* Return to training
 

- 2022
* Knee's are more or less fine now, but they're still painful from arthritis and I can sit on my heels but it's not comfortable
* Shoulders are still painful, end up getting surgery on one (I have some restricted range of motion, still in pain, but it's better)
* Get MRI's and discover I have multiple herniated discs in my thoracic spine, and bulge in my lumbar
* The fainting continues
* NONE of the doctors except for my pain management doctors have recommended I stop training, all other doctors encourage me to continue exercise but to listen to my body and work around the pain.

Everyone is really friendly, tough training, it's close to my house, and the head coach is a competitive black belt who consistently podiums at all the big ibjjf tournaments. All good right? But our gym has been consistently losing higher belts over the years.

I believe the owner/head instructor opened the gym well over 10 years ago, yet there is only 4 other black belts under him, and although they are great people, they aren't very competitive rolls due to age, injuries ect. There are, some very tough brown and purple belts at the gym, however two brown belts just left, one being who I considered my main coach at the gym, and also another purple belt. Before that I've seen many purples, browns, and two blackbelts leave. I'm frustrated because these were all guys that I look up to, amazing training partners and coaches.

I have not had any direct conversation with people about why they've left, only heard rumors. But I think it's always because of disagreements with the owner. He's not an easy guy to talk to, and on more than one occasion I've heard him talk down to students, even in front of the entire class, but I've personally never had issues with him. He rarely ever coaches me to be honest as he's either off competing or not coaching the class I'm at. As far as I'm aware, he doesn't allow cross training. He never rolls with whitebelts, has a strict gi policy where we can only wear his brand, and charges for belt testing. Just that alone should make me leave like everyone else I know, but I have fun at the gym and like the students there.

2400,"Hi all,

For context, I'm a very small dude (5'3"" and 130lbs). Very new to BJJ and love it so far, despite being the smallest guy in the gym. One thing that has hindered me is two injuries in a rather short time span: bruised ribs and more recently a bruised sternum. Both were caused by rolling with two bigger guys (6 ft and 200+ lbs) that put intense pressure on me. Ribs were bruised from someone squeezing me with their legs in full guard, and the sternum was from someone bearing his weight down on my chest with his knee.

I realize the best way to avoid these is to ""just not get caught"" in those positions, but I'm wondering if anyone has any other advice to avoid these kinds of injuries? I don't feel the pain until afterwards, so my brain doesn't think to tap in the moment. I've thought about asking some of the really big guys to just not put their knees on my ribs/back/chest during rolls, but prefer not to handicap the other people I'm rolling with (big guys- how would you feel about this request?). Appreciate any tips here or any other tips in general for rolling as a smaller person!

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I find a lot of value in rolling with the bigger guys 99% of the time, it's great for improving my speed and escapes.

The site has multiple courses and I started  with the **nogi 50/50 - 90/10 course**. I am a gi guy and this course is the **best bridge course that connects modern gi bjj (double pull, bolos, crab rides, 50/50, etc.) to nogi bjj with heel hooks**. Most of the positions will look familiar and accessible to the gi guy who likes double pull situations in gi. And it will look at these familiar positions from a point of view that considers heel hook defense and offense.

The 2nd course I looked at was the **RNC leg grip course** which is also a double pull course nogi. I have all four of Mikey Musumeci's berimbolo instructional. I have watched the Bolo Bros (highly recommended instructors - Maira and Salles) courses on Grappler's Guide. And yet, I was still able to see a very **unique and powerful attack in Lachlan's course not seen in those other instructional. (See photo of the said attack from double pull.)**

2413,"I'm wondering if anyone else has ever experienced this, but today we had a guy visit our gym, blue belt who happens to be a personal trainer. This guy is super ripped, like 6 pack abs, and everything. Eventually we get around to rolling, and I roll with this guy, and I feel nothing that I'd expect from his physique. His muscles feel like anybody else's body, he doesn't feel strong at all, even though aesthetically, he would appear to be so. I could even muscle out of bad positions successfully against him. 

In contrast, when I roll with my coach, (who's like a 5'6, unassuming guy, doesn't even look in shape), touching him feels like touching stone. Even when he's relaxed you can just feel that he's super muscle bound. You would think that he's flexing all the time, but the man is actually just like that. My coach says he only lifts weights like once or twice a week, meanwhile the other guy literally lives and breathes the gym, yet feels like any other random person.

Has anybody else ever had a similar experience? Does anyone have an idea on why there is such a disparity between the two? My coach has maybe a decade and a half of age on this guy (mid 20s vs early 40s), is it the fabled old man strength? Does rolling bjj day in day out really get you that strong in comparison to the average (or even gym going) individual? I'm genuinely so confused right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR, Personal trainer stopped by the gym, rolled with him and even though he's shredded, he felt like rolling with Steve from accounting. Meanwhile, my coach, who looks like a random guy of the street, feels like a boulder when I roll with him. Why the disparity?",subs,bjj

Just mess around a little do some judo, but on of the days in the week I learn a lot, that's when everyone comes. 1-2 days is not enough for me. And the 1 day is just messing around I am not a big of that since I am there to learn. 

What can I do, should I travel cities and go back to my gym, or keep trying learning judo. It is good martial art but it's the only one in my area and it's not many days.",subs,bjj

2. I have not unlocked some unknown secret nobody else sees. I’m just watching videos and unpacking what I see. 

That said: as a 10P guy, this position that seems to be a feature of Priit’s back defense game seems predisposed to show entries to the 10P truck and twister systems. I have actively baited that position to achieve those results (in obvious, admittedly less-than-world-class circumstances). The discussion point I guess is…what do you think Priit would do if I attacked along that line of thinking? What pieces of this “Hawking” position, which seems vulnerable on the surface, might be preventing such attacks?

I suddenly heard a pop. Like how you would pop your fingers, but heavier and louder. I kinda felt it in my knee, bit it didn't hurt at all so I asked the guy wether he broke his arm or something. We just sparred further.

Later that evening, and the next evening as well, my knee felt irritated. I had a light pain. That went away as I didn't go to BJJ class for about a week.

After about 2 months I started feeling some kind of irritation again in my knee. Especially when I stand up for too long my knee gets irritated and I need to sit down. Like, when I work on Saturdays I pretty much walk the entire shift. Than I can feel it.

What could this be? I'm not sure if I should go to the doctor.

I don't know if part of this is psychological. Because years ago I had bone cancer in my left knee (so my other knee) and that made me suffer from a lot of pain for a full year. The pain was outright traumatic. Although I am fully healed from that, I'm unsure if this new knee pain maybe is not as bad as I may believe it to be.

2556,"Hi everyone! 

I’m a 1 stripe white belt (guess that we don’t need to check this moment) and I’ve been training regularly for 11 months now. 
I want to compete and I’ll probably start mma later. I train in a very good gym, coaches are great, people are great, everything is great. 
The problem is distance. I drive to another city, it takes about 20 minutes one way. 

Not so bad you might say, but I don’t like to drive when everyone’s driving home from work and the highway turns into a formula 1 track. I’m not getting stressed, I just don’t like it. 
And I’m just too lazy to drive.

The biggest problem is gas prices and I don’t think that they’ll go down. I’m a bit broke but I can afford driving. I’ll probably get a new job soon, so I’ll have to drive longer and it can get even more expensive. In this case, saving some money would be a great idea. 

In my current gym we have trainings 6 days a week. Both Gi and NoGi. I train 2 days a week with white belts, but other days I roll with higher belts which I think is beneficial for my development. The most awesome thing about this gym is introduction course for total beginners. I took it when I first started bjj and it was really great. I didn’t get smashed on my first day and could learn basics with other noobs. 

There’s a gym 5 minutes from my home. I trained there once and got smashed, but I was a total beginner back then. They didn’t have warm up (the dream of all purple belts I guess).
They have trainings 6 day a week + open mat (Gi &amp; NoGi). They have higher demands for those who compete regularly and I like it. 

There’s also another gym 8 minutes from my home. This gym is owned by a professional UFC fighter. They recently started with bjj. 
I want to focus only on bjj now and the closest gym seems to be better. 

My membership ends in two months, so I’m planning to try the closest gym again.

Is it worth to drive longer for a better gym?
I really want to save some time and money.

Trying to be objective here, because I was told when I signed up, attendance isn’t everything but it’s tracked and is a major factor in promotion.  However, I rarely get tapped by white belts and regularly tap 2 stripe blues.

I see plenty of guys with notably worse jj get promoted over me because they attend 4 days per week.  I know my ego should gtfo and I’m still having a GREAT time going to BJJ, just wondering how common of practice this is?

I've reached a breaking point where realizing that the gym I am at know is not very suitable for my liking. Im 210 5'9 and my only training partner is a 6'2 260 dude who has zero self awareness and goes 110% rolling. Dont get me wrong, I am able to control this bigger guy. But once he starts, the self control and awareness goes to zero. atm i am out due to him ripping deep windpipe choke and basically lifting me off my knees with it ( I tap but it takes him a couple second to realize). my neck is terribly sore with trouble swallowing and talking. Everyone else is hesitant to role with me because the next lightest to me is 170lb and im a bit on the skillful side. 

I lowkey hate this gym but i carry massive guilt letting the coach know that I want my gym membership cancelled. He let me run open mats with his key so I believe he may think our relationship is stronger.

2566,"I see problems with armbars in both sport and self-defense.

1. No matter what position the armbar is done from (mount, side control, guard, or back) they risk your position. An escaped armbar often results in a scramble or your guard getting passed. 

2. Unlike chokes, the armbar is not necessarily a fight-ending move. And ss you commit your body to breaking one arm, the opponent's free arm may be able to access a weapon. 

I'm starting to see a hierarchy of submissions. At the top are submissions that put your opponent to sleep from a dominant position with low risk of position loss, the ability to control both of your opponent's arms, and the ability to quickly disengage and get away. Armbars just don't score very highly when considering these criteria while the Rear Naked Choke from Back and Cross Choke from High Mount score very highly.

so im loving the pass Andre shows in this video, i believe it is usually called ""Variation of Sao Paolo Pass""

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCp6xctn1lQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCp6xctn1lQ)

Usually i have no problems getting the arm behind the back. Then i walk my feet around the side with the trapped arm.

I struggle with what comes next:  
As far as i understand it, i am supposed to keep my partner flat on his back, so the angle of my hip and legs compared to his legs and hip increases. This should make it super hard for him to keep his feet closed behind my back.

 What my partners usually do, is comming up on one shoulder (of the trapped arm), facing in  my direction. This prevents the angle to increase and i am not able to open the guard anymore.

Is there a way to excel at Judo without being explosive? How about other grappling arts? In this episode, Shintaro and Peter go in depth about explosiveness in Judo and other grappling arts.

All the 77 and 88kg guys are probably too small and may have a better chance in sub only but im not even sure they are on the same technical level as Gordon. 

I would say Craig for sub only but then again Meregali isn't too far behind Craig and I would think it's not close between Gordon and Nicholas. I think Craig may be as technical as Gordon but his style is just not as well suited for comp.

After they tapped, they seemed a bit pissed off. They told me the darce is more of a 'strength choke' and that I shouldn't use my strength and only use the techniques I've been taught by the instructor. 

I felt like a bit of a dick after that and tried rolling without using strength. I got mounted pretty quickly and because I don't know many techniques, all I could do was spam 'trap and roll'. Eventually on the 50th attempt it worked, and I got on top. However, it still felt like I was using strength to do the movement.

2621,"Bear with me. 

I started training at the only local gym in my remote town just over a year ago. It’s small. I’m a bigger guy, 215, construction worker, 37, diverse athletic background (rugby, CrossFit, weightlifting etc). They gym I’m at is very limited on upper belts, and the ones that are there are much smaller than me. It didn’t take very long for me to stop feeling like I’m getting smashed and dominated. That’s not to say I’m tapping those guys, at all, ever, I’m just not getting dominated or subbed very often. 

I believe that survival period, as well as having a group of more experienced people that can easily dominate you is crucial, and I feel that by missing out on it, it’s ultimately going to reflect in my development. To counteract this, I’ve spent the past 9 months starting primarily from bottom, training defence, learning some basic white belt quality sweeps, and only allowing myself to go on offence if I earn top position. If the roll resets I go back to bottom. I understand there’s a trade off here because it’ll limit development on takedowns etc, so I make sure I still get some work in on my feet. 

My coach is a BB, and can absolutely wreck me and sub me at will, which is awesome, but I’m very aware that his job is to divide his attention amongst all the players, so I’m careful to not be a new guy trying to monopolize his time. 

My question is, how can I curate a more survival based/defensive rolling experience with the tools i have on hand? Is missing out on years of upper belt domination and getting subbed a ton detrimental, or is there a benefit to it in that I get to work on a more diverse set of techniques and positions in most rolls?

Is smelling of coffee/coffee breath a “no-no” similar to not brushing your teeth, not wearing deodorant, or not washing your gi? 

Idk, I found it interesting. I’ve drank it before morning class a couple times and it wasn’t brought up, but hearing that this morning perked my ears up lol I suppose when the gym has its first class of the day, nothing really has much of a scent, and coffee breath isn’t exactly a “nice smell.”

2631,"TLDR: Just another noob post about finger pain/grip strength.

Context Started BJJ about 6 weeks ago transitioning from a lifting background. For the first 4-5 weeks I was training 7-8 hours a week but ended up with the prototypical finger pain/stiffness newer folks get from not knowing how to grip properly.

I started taping my fingers, stretching my forearms/fingers more, and doing hand mobility drills which all helped. Last week I only did one yes-gi class to continue letting my hands rest.

Since then almost all of the pain is gone and the finger stiffness in the mornings has improved substantially.

Despite all of the mobility work/rest time, my grip feels incredibly weak (way weaker than when I started). I went to lift a 50lb back of snow salt a few days ago and had to underhook it because I couldn't just grip and lift.

Questions

Is a weakening grip normal for BJJ beginners who experience finger pain/stiffness or is this more serious?

Going to continue to keep the volume low/rest, but wondering if there are any exercises I can be doing to speed up recovery and get my grip strength back faster.

Can someone share resources/info on proper grip mechanics? I've looked around and most of what I've found has been ""don't death grip"". Of these grips, I assume the ""cylinder grip"" (death grip) is wrong and you want to be something closer to a ""hook grip""?

Last year i posted about competing for the first time ever, as a blue belt and won silver.

There were many losses but they taught me valuable lessons and I just refused to give up and quit. I entered a local tournament last minute and won gold in the women’s no gi bracket. I’ve seen a lot of growth in the last year and it’s great to see those results come to fruition. I just want to say for those who are considering quitting, having a losing streak, please don’t quit.

2651,"Lately, I found that if I time situations right, there will always be a small window of escape, but it has to be done quickly, otherwise it’s gone. For example, if my rolling partner does not finish applying side-control on time? I can slide under him and take his back. He is standing with one leg to escape my guard? I can slide under it and take the back; It’s not even something I think about most of the time, but my body somehow knows. 

Anyway, I have barely pulled any submissions because I am rolling with more experienced people, so I had no choice but to learn to survive and escape. Is this normal? At what point do I attempt escapes…only on the brand new white belts that dont know what theyre doing?

I recently moved and changed my school. At my old gym (which was competitive) I was by far one of the lightest dudes and could easily roll somewhat hard and nobody would mind as they were all literally giants and we had no women. Now, at my new gym (more of a self defence/ a little competitive) for the first time I see plenty dudes near my size and women training and I literally had no idea how to roll. For example there was this one women for sure lighter than me, but looked like she had more experience than me and I had no idea what to do. Like I submitted her once, but after that she hold me in mount till the end of the round and she was stronger than I expected. 
So how to you really roll with weaker partners? What I tried is using as less strength as I can and focusing on the technique, but also going very light while submitting. Should I keep that up or do you still want semi hard rolls for the practise?  Obviously I would never slam anybody no matter if lighter or heavier or do other dangerous movements, but for example if I hold an armbar should I lean fully back and try breaking your grip normally or should I do a light version of giving chances to escape even your more experienced or even a higher belt than me?",subs,bjj

I’m glad he apologised, but I think this is a lesson for me not to roll with heavyweights who I don’t know well. I also clearly need to work on making sure my triangles aren’t as easily countered, no matter how unsafe the slam was.

I want to be clear though, I hope guys don’t become afraid of rolling with women because of things like this.

2674,"Good Morning!  
  
Wanted to share my experience over the last year in BJJ, don’t mean to inundate the subreddit with lame stuff…but here we go!   
  
I started BJJ at 38 last November and had zero clue what I was doing. I had recently quit drinking and smoking and wanted an outlet for all this new found energy and BJJ fit the bill. When I started I didn’t know anything and just kept coming to class and taking my lumps. I was awkward and only a few people would talk to me. I kept at it though and continued to train anywhere from 2-4 times a week and slowly but surely gained the ability to somewhat defend myself and learned some basic moves. During this time I broke a rib and also crushed cartilage in one of my ribs as well leaving me a giant forever lump on my rib. That absolutely didn’t stop me though as I had now become somewhat obsessed with getting better and better. 
  
Fast forward to October of this year and I entered my first tournament weighing 205 at age 39 and won a gold in no-gi and silver in gi. That pushed things even further as I now am so hungry to train and improve. I went from being basically scared to roll to rolling at the end of class being my favorite thing.  
  
Over this time the benefits of BJJ have been astronomical and my body has completely transformed from flabby semi-alcoholic to athlete and my confidence has risen while depression has slowly been erased. I am 100% an advocate for this sport now and just  so glad that I started even though of course I wish I would have started earlier but as my wife says “maybe this was the perfect time, what if you started 10 years ago and couldn’t hang because of the drinking etc.”. She is a smart lady and has been my rock I depend on through my BJJ experience.   
  
Wanted to share with someone as everyone around me is annoyed by me talking about BJJ already like a typical white belt noob. I’m not great at Jiu Jitsu yet and that’s ok. I’ve found that the best part is just experiencing the sport in general! Thanks for reading!",subs,bjj
2675,"I started training back in 2008, but I only started because I was trying to ""learn MMA"".

I quickly realized that I wasn't actually learning anything. It was a good cardio workout, but that's about it.

In addition to the ""MMA classes"", they also had BJJ classes. I didn't really know what BJJ was, but I figured I would try it since it was just ONE THING (rather than cramming 10 different arts into an hour long class).

It's over 13 years later, and I'm now a brown belt. It's kinda crazy how I stumbled across this though.

2681,"I recently started training in the middle of the year after a long time of wanting to try BJJ but ultimately not taking the leap, but as a friend moved to my city he found a gym as he has been a long-time practitioner of MMA and convinced me to start in the beginner course (the gym is small, we only fill one gi, no-gi and beginner class). So I start, and it is the best thing I have done, not only is it a fun way to train and get in better shape but I just seem to have a knack for it. So a little over a month into training the coach says I could come to the advanced group as well, even better. Now I get to train more. 

Now only a week ago, during the advanced group were rolling and probably the best guy in the group slaps on a solid body triangle and tries to move me over to the side, only problem is it's on mostly my floating ribs. And so as he squeezes and I try my damndest to not follow with him I feel my rib crack, it didn't hurt just felt like something my ribs shouldn't do, my personal opinion is ribs shouldn't make noise. So as any rational being, I fight until he gets the RNC and tap, and after that, I kind of realized that yeah, ribs should not do that. So I go home, no more sparring or training just rest. Wake up next morning, fuuuck, my rib does hurt a solid bit. So turns out i have a fractured rib, not too bad. 

But it has now hit me how slow everything is going as I go to school, go home and repeat. So this is to say, you don't know what you have until you lose it, and it makes me want to train even more every day that goes.",subs,bjj

2689,"A question for you black belts and instructors. Has anyone achieved a black belt without forming a relationship with their coach? I have never viewed anyone as my coach or mentor. This was never a reflection of their ability to roll, but often times a reflection of their teaching ability/dedication, or teaching style, standards maybe, or I just was not interested in the style of BJJ they pursued because I knew it wouldn't physically work for me. I'm sure they were all qualified and legit guys whose technique worked for most students, I'm not being critical, I recognize that I'm an outlier, there was just nothing about them that put me in awe enough to worship them like many people do their coaches. And I acknowledge I'm somewhat learning... differently abled. A little of the autism got in me. Whatever the reason I have always achieved my personal progress studying independently and just brought it to their mats for trial and error. I can't recall more than a dozen techniques I actually learned in class during my 17 years of training. But I know hundreds I put together on my own.

I never had a real long term home team. I've just pinballed around between academies. Some for just a couple months, some a few years, was an assistant coach and ran fundamentals classes for a couple years, designed my own classes for about a year, but never met anyone I thought was so accomplished, knowledgeable and good at coaching ME PERSONALLY that I wanted or needed anything more from them than an environment to work and experiment in.  A couple of times I even left academies after a belt promotion and didn't accept the promotion because I didn't feel the instructors made people do enough to earn them, including me. I didn't want to be a fraud. So I would toss the new belt, strip a couple stripes off my lower rank, wear that and go somewhere else until I felt I was deserving of a promotion and accepted the next one that came. (You know, when you are actually beating a fair percentage of the rank right above you, surviving even higher ranks, and always beating commensurate ranks in your age range to demonstrate you've earned it).

Now I am old and falling apart, unmotivated, utterly exhausted beyond belief by meeting new people, have difficulty even going into class I am so burnt out, and many of the guys I brought into BJJ when I was like a 4 stripe blue are already black belts. I don't know if any of them are any good or deserved it given the circumstances, but I do know it's about time I finish this journey but I am no longer getting enough ROI simply attending classes. So the point of the post is: is that even possible for someone like me who isn't a dedicated student of any specific coach? I understand the hesitance to award anyone a black belt. I respect that it's YOUR reputation going around another person's waist. But I'm too far into this to form such a relationship, and to be honest if it takes more than 2 more years at 3x classes a week I'm going to wash out of BJJ. I'm SO TIRED. I've given so much to this sport (as in I need fake body parts now) it's time it gave something back to me. But I can't find a way to progress or any path forward that's actually going to reward my effort with measurable, regular increases in skill worthy of a promotion.

I don't know what the coach has said to him, if any. I keep running from him but I get matched up with him. I want him to wear a gi but not sure how he's been coming for 3 weeks with no gi.

He stares me down from across the mat when I mess up, and when we roll he'll let me get some bs sweep, then when I go for anything in side mount/mount he wristlocks the shit out of me.  Then he just holds me in one position for the rest of the round while looking away and talking to someone else, then quickly turns and grabs a submission.  He weighs 100 lbs more than me and although I have tried to find an effective defense I haven't had any success.  I actually asked him to teach me a defense to the wristlocks he gets me in, but he just looked down at me for a second and went to go talk to someone else.

Kinda got to me. I still train hard and strength and condition, yet I’m almost 30 and some of these young guns have a decade of grappling experience. 

The thought of that almost made me want to not compete again lol. But I love the spirit of competition. I’m one of those almost 30 year olds who found a lifelong passion during the mid 20’s.

2703,"After seeing the same things on White Belt Wednesday every week, I feel this needs to be re-iterated.  

It seems like people start training for a few months and think ""ok I know Jiu Jitsu"".  You don't.

If you are getting stuck under side control, or getting your guard passed, or whatever it is, don't feel bad.  Your training partners have more practice than you.  It's as simple as that.  They know the same escapes you do, so they know what you're trying to do.  They also have more experience keeping you down, or passing your guard or whatever.  It's just a matter of more reps.

Sure, there are cases where you have 2 stripes, and the brand new guy is an athletic freak and cuts through you like butter, but you shouldn't feel bad about that either.  You can't control who walks into the door and starts training.

Have some perspective.  This shit takes years.",subs,bjj

2710,"For context, I am a 5’2 woman, maybe 115 pounds or so.

I’m used to being smashed every training due to my (lack of) size and strength, I’m still open to rolling with significantly larger people as long as they’re aware they could snap me like a twig. I feel it makes my technique better and mimics a real self defence situation.

I rarely ever submit larger people, especially men, but a decent portion of the time I’ve submitted larger men, they completely spaz out when they realise they can’t escape.

This one time recently was the last straw. I was rolling with a newer blue belt (than I am), maybe 6 foot 180 pounds, seemed incredibly kind and understanding of his size. He submitted me a few times, nothing out of the ordinary given the size difference.

I almost got him with a triangle choke, and he tried to rip his arm out of it, then stood up and slammed me incredibly hard into the mat. I completely wasn’t ready because I didn’t expect him to pull something like that, my head bounced off the mat and my neck took a lot of the impact too.

I was completely winded and trying to catch my breath, and he mumbled an apology walked away. Coach yelled at him and he left. To be fair, his buddies were sort of egging him on by jeering and telling him he shouldn’t be submitted by a girl. Still, a hurt ego doesn’t mean you have to obliterate my spine!

Went to doctor, no breaks thankfully and no major damage to my neck or head, minor concussion and bruising to my spine and ribs.

I’ve had this happen a few times and I’m sick of not feeling safe in some gyms. I can’t reliably avoid these people because my job requires me to move frequently, so I have to learn hard lessons on who not to roll with every time.

Dude insisted he wouldn’t go 100% or anything, as he could see I was a little hesitant to roll with him given his size.

Returning off a two week break due to burnout. 

I was just getting stressed and nitpicking my game way too much and got extremely burnt out on everything not just BJJ. 

I’m headed towards my blue belt, or at least that’s what’s said to me by higher belts, so I don’t want to quit. 

I need help structuring my training. 

I train 5x weekly (2x Gi, 2x No-Gi) I also supplement my training with 2x days off strength training (5/3/1) and alongside this I referee football (soccer) at a relatively high level. 

I want to avoid burnout and injuries which have began to pop up.

I’m a psychology graduate student at the University of Trier (Germany) and  part of a  research team that focuses on the characteristics of  effective   practicing and attaining expertise. To put it in different  terms, we are   conducting a study to ask the question: “*How do I have to practice to become good at what I do?”*

To find out more about this, we have conducted a short online survey, that  allows participants to share information about how exactly they    practice a specific skill. Gaining expertise about various types of   sport is an important part of our research, which is why we are looking   for  people who practice/teach/practice some kind of sport to partake  in  our study.

The survey is anonymous, voluntary and purely scientific (non-commercial). At the end of the  questionnaire, you will get your individual exercise profile   reported  back to you and can partake in a   raffle for 5 Amazon   vouchers worth  100 euros each.

But one specific concept I talked about here in 2015 was my sci-fi series about MMA gladiators who represent their nations as a proxy for armies / wars. You guys really gave me a lift then, at a point when I was just starting out as an author and was pretty fearful of what people might think. I self-pub'd the book, and it sold decently, but more importantly, it showed me there was a market for readers that appreciate realistic combat woven into a fun story.

From there... well, the book got acquired last spring by one of the largest publishers in the world (Hachette / Orbit Books), and their team helped me edit the book to launch to a wider audience (don't worry, if anything I've added MORE grappling). There's about 100 additional pages in this new version and I really think it's leveled up, so even those who have read the old version will dig the new one. I can't wait for you guys to get a hold of it (it's [up for pre-order now](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/alexander-darwin/the-combat-codes/9780316493000/) with the new cover to show off). 

For those who are unfamiliar, here's a quote from **Ryan Hall**: *""The Combat Codes is a great read for any fan of realistic martial arts fiction... a compelling sci-fi / fantasy plot full of true-to-life martial arts action.""*

Anyhow, I want to thank those of you who have supported me through this long journey. I've kept tabs on this commmunity over the years, and though it has certainly changed, I see the same strong base framed on a love for grappling.

However, I've gotten so comfortable on my back that I struggle to actually do much other than defend.  I do try the occasional sweep from hal guard get on top but then around 30 seconds later and I'm on back again.

2785,"I think the stress and fear of competing comes from focusing on egocentric point of view. But if you look at yourself from a third person's perspective, you will be just another guy doing another fun activity!

For instance: Parachuting and Sky diving is arguably the most scary and adrenaline-intensive activity (after actual cage fighting). But your perspective, they're just another people having fun, enjoying their youth while they can, achieving new things in life!

You didn't concern yourself w/ the micro details that can scare someone sunk in the egocentric point of view. E.g., that the plane may crash, the parachute may not work, they might slip from the plane, etc.

In other words: I think looking at you &amp; your competition from Marco level rather than Micro level will relief much of its fear, focusing on the Macro will make it more fun.

To put my aforementioned theory into BJJ competition application: Try to think of competition as you squeezing the athleticism of your youth while you can, in the future you will tell your friends and children about your martial arts and aport journey, how fun it was, about all the things you tried!

I believe this may turn the fear from competing to enjoyment, as it reminds you how irrelevant the micro details you fear are, and how you're overlooking the good big picture.

I’ve got a comp this upcoming Saturday and I’ve got a fit of cauliflower ear (Never had it before).

2791,"I lost a tournament (and ended up on second place, which is still great) with a guy who admitted that he's on HGH and testosterone. Since he was a cool guy we talked after the fight for a while and he said that we (me and him) are 40 years old and it is just dumb not to use proper steroids.

I felt like I lost because he caught me in a loop choke and I had not strength to posture up (so I need to work on my strength and conditioning) and I also should brake his grip before taking him down (so I need to work on my setups before going for subs/takedowns). But then I started thinking that maybe he's right? I'm not planing more kids, BJJ is something I love to do and I'd like to stick with it for the rest of my life, maybe even open up a gym one day (after receiving black belt in some distant future). Wining important competitions would most likely help a lot.

On the other hand I have my successful job, nice family and wining competitions is not the most important thing for me. Especially just local small tournaments, they are not ADCC or IBJJF finals.

2824,"Hey everyone,

I've been involved in grappling for about seventeen years now. Judo and Wrestling growing up, BJJ for about seven years. Most of it at my current gym. I teach a no gi class twice a couple times a week but I've been having some issues the last two years. I've been a purple belt for about 4 years. 3 of those training five times a week or so, the last year it has been closer to two to three times a week. 

My issue started I guess when I tested for my brown belt for the second time two years ago. First time I tested I got told to work on the Gracie self defense stuff. I think it's nonsense but I went ahead borrowed a book and memorized it. Did fine on the second test but the association head didn't like that pretty much everything I do is no gi focused even though I go to a gi class at a separate school once a week and open mats in the gi once a week. 

Anyway, it's his right to hold people back for any reason or no reason so I didn't think much of it until he promoted like four people to brown belt the next day, only one would I say was deserving.

Anyway that was two years ago. Since then I've trained minimum of twice a week, mostly due to life stuff. Sometimes four or five. I've still been teaching the no gi class during this whole time.

Anyway I haven't been getting charged for gym dues in a couple years. Recently the head coach asked me to start paying again. We never spoke about it but I assumed the not paying was compensation for teaching the no gi. I feel like it's kind of the last straw. There's a closer gym I go to open mats that offered me a teach for no tuition deal a year back or so.

When I first started training I lived ten minutes away from my current gym. Since then moved and now it's forty minutes away but I stayed out of both loyalty and the free membership.

Am I wrong for wanting to switch? I don't feel like I learn a ton at my current one. It's very older hobbyist focused and only the head coach and one other guy can give me a decent roll. The other gym isn't all that different in that regard but they've said they wouldn't hold back rank because of self defense or not doing mostly gi.",subs,bjj

TRIGGER WARNING

So I started BJJ recently. I did not realize that it may end up causing old trauma to come to the surface.

I have an ex that hit me in the past. He obviously had anger issues and I guess I was kind of afraid of him throughout the relationship. While he did not 'sexually assault' me or anything, my no was never respected and there were several occasions where I gave in and just said yes after repeatedly saying no because it was just easier. To a point where I would just lay there silently waiting for it to be over.

All this was 5 years ago. I was 18. I never told anyone and pretended it never happened in my head too.

Now, I recently started BJJ and certain moves brought flashbacks from some instances. I ended up having a complete meltdown after one of the classes. I've been crying non stop because I feel like I'm experiencing and processing all the pain from 5 years ago for the first time.

While I'm grateful to the class for making me realizing that I'm still affected by this, I'm not sure what comes next. I want to keep going to class but I'm afraid I'm going to keep having breakdowns like this.

I'm wondering if this is a common experience with women who start BJJ and how I should handle it.

I guess I'm going to watch some bjj videos to desensitize myself from some of the stuff so I'm not shocked again in class and kind of know what to expect.

The good things:

The coach is amazing. He noticed I was panicking and did his best to support me and calm me down.

I'm also in therapy, and have scheduled a session for Monday to talk this through.

I also do WANT to continue BJJ. I think it's an excellent life skill for a woman. But I'm not sure if it's a good idea for me right now because of this.

There was a scuffle by the coat check, my friend may have skipped the line and these two dudes started getting aggressive. At the time I couldn't wait to get the opportunity to get into a fight, I was an idiot, but here was my chance. I arm dragged the dude and got him in a rnc, my friend was fist fighting the other guy, while I tried to gently lay the guy down a bouncer came up behind me and put me in a rnc of his own causing me to drop the guy I was chocking.

We got escorted out the club. The dudes that we were fighting wanted to continue outside, we were already inside the cab and the guy I got in the rnc was pounding on the car calling me to come out, my ego wanted to accept the challenge but I pictured rolling on the cold and wet concrete with this dude and it just screamed as a terrible idea so we got out of there unscathed.

I work at x-ray in local hospital. I volunteered to make presentation about safety in BJJ, because of increased injuries in our local gym, especially between white belts but other can benefit from it too.

Thanks a lot for any advice",subs,bjj
2911,"And the Blue Belt isn't a small guy. His size is perhaps above average &amp; looks quite athletic too.

Honestly it must been demoralizing for that bb (it was for me) 

If a strong guy in his first days can smother even a decently athletic/sized grappler -in both ground &amp; standing- who's receiving training w/ Edwin Najmi for probably ~3 years...

So I looked to the last of Stevens’s Olympics and saw who in the wrestling bracket was in or around his weight class, and it was none other than my personal favorite wrestler J’Den Cox, who took home bronze that year. I think a “death match” is extreme, but, I have seen J’Den is rolling with the likes of Gordon Ryan, Nicky Rod, and even Jon Jones lately.

I've put a screenshot in, and I know the position is not identical but it is similar enough that I am concerned and wanted to consult the hive mind. Is there a way to counter/avoid this other than just ""Be aware of your opponents grips and don't let them lock it in at all""? Or was there something better about foot placement that could have been done? Is there a technical counter to this or just kick out wildly abandoning position to avoid being submitted? Is there something else I'm missing? Thanks all x

Next sesh I went with a bigger blue belt, and the guy was hard as if we were competing for the world championship, as I went on turtle, the guy hit my face with his arm trying to fit the RNC.

After a couple years of training, I know I'm still new to the sport, and I like to learn and respect everyone in the room, but I think that the best approach and the more sustainable over time, in terms of energy and injuries is the soltinho training porra, it is ok to put pressure on positions and put strength in the techniques but, trying to maximize the technical aspect of bjj and not battering your partners with no technique.

As you hurt your training partner doing ugly moves, he gets angry and the fight escalates, so you are not training smartly, and this might intoxicate the whole gym atmosphere

Looking for a school with a strong competitive push and good culture. Will be attending at least 5 sessions per week and competing as much as I can afford. Attempting to steer clear of the Gracie Barra crowd due to reputation and practices, but understand that each gym is its own and there are still amazing educators under that umbrella. 

Have done my extensive research and narrowed down my list to the following: all are close enough to ride to and not impinge on work/school/family life. 

1. Garage Bondi - would not disclose price  
2. SJJA Zetland - would not disclose price  
3. Compound Grappling - wrestling focused, $50 per week   
4. Igor MMA - no price listed   
5. Alavanca BJJ - $60 per week, new small school  
6. Gracie Bondi / Botany - would not disclose price 

Also wanted to enquire about what standard pricing is for those in this central Sydney area? I've enquired with most, and they are all very secretive/refuse to share pricing prior to doing their trials. This leaves a bad taste in my mouth and really puts me off, but they all seem to be doing it?

We have a directive against choke holds due to deaths by asphyxia. Almost exclusively from pile ons or the inexperienced holding chokes on heavily intoxicated but it is what it is.

In restraint training we are taught standing armbar (far arm controls wrist while the near forearm is fulcrum) or a 2 on 1 wrist lock as pain compliance while walking them out. 

Trouble is the big boys (I’m 6”2, 80kg) can muscle out if they want or at least turn in and clinch. Even had a guy half my size do it last weekend when his friends surrounded and grabbed at us and he managed to get a shot in and knock a tooth out.

Last night I’m walking behind someone with inside wrist control on both arms when i feel him start to struggle. Due to last week I thought fuck this and immediately slept him, as soon as he went limp I took back bodylock over the arms and carried him out as he came to.

Now to me this is perfect, nothing (I can think of) is more effective and controlling than a rear naked. The more they struggle the faster they hang themselves, 10 seconds later they’re outside waking from a nap. Due to the law this will eventually end up costing me though so I need alternatives.

I know what you’re thinking, and we thought the same thing… “you want to try Jiu jitsu?” He could not handle anyone being on top of him at all. If someone got mount, he tapped immediately. If they got a solid side control, he tapped immediately. He would get close to hyperventilating anytime this occurred. 

We ended up putting him through a sort of systematic desensitization process of pairing him with guys who were higher belts and could control themselves, and have them put this guy in varying stages of pressure with mount and side control, and we worked him up to being comfortable over a period of time. He’s fine now and you couldn’t tell the difference. 

I know in BJJ a lot of beginners trying things out get turned off initially by the sheer uncomfortableness of top game pressure, be it from past trauma or just never having experienced that feeling of helplessness underneath someone.

Now I feel that my offense is getting a lot better, but since I got my blue belt people have less mercy of me so defense, specially my scapes from side mount and full mount have stopped working for the most part. I really want to start putting time on the mats and off the mats practicing and studying pin scapes, so I hereby ask you again.

Which are in your oppinion the best pin scapes instructionals and why?

Thanks a lot!!",subs,bjj

3022,"I got a staph infection on my right posterior thigh about 3 months ago. Go antibiotics, got it cleared up using betadine and bandaging. About 3 weeks ago I got another right below my right knee on the lateral aspect of my leg. Did the same thing, got it drained, got bacterum and used betadine and bandaging til it cleared up. I went to Jiu Jitsu last night and tonight and now I have another spot on my right knee that is tender, red and swollen. I’ve started wearing tights under my shorts to prevent bacteria getting on my skin more. I’m just upset and wondering what I can do for a solution. I missed my blue belt promotion because of my second infection. I feel like I’m missing out on so much training. I shower as soon as I get home from my 10 minute commute from Jiu Jitsu, I immediately wash my clothes. Any advice? I’m going to urgent care again tomorrow to get it looked at, so wish me luck. Thanks",subs,bjj
