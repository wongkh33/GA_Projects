0,"Hi guys, just needing a bit of an unbiased advise. I’ll try and keep this in dot point format and straight to the point. 

Background:
- Male - 28 year old - training roughly 5x a week every year for the past 3-4 years 
- 100kg, 46kg muscle mass, 20% body fat. 
- strength is no issue at all, but conditioning is a problem. Both cardio and muscular endurance suck. 
- I train in a bootcamp style class/environment using mostly bootcamp equipment - I.e no bars/rigs, rings, ropes, heavy weights (floors are wooden) 
- Although it’s a bootcamp, the programs are still influenced by CrossFit styled workouts as the coaches are CrossFit athletes
- Workouts are usually 30-40 min TABATA, AMRAPS and partnered WODs with 2x strength components in the week. Workouts are really taxing (about 8-10 RPE)
- last 2 years I’ve also been doing 2x additional program days in the gym programmed by the coach of the bootcamp. This is so that I can do more CrossFit-style training with the equipment, particularly to build my conditioning. 

Issue:
- starting to become demotivated as the opens and recent local comps have really made me realise just how far I am from where I’d like to be (at least making quarters). Currently in the 70-80 percentile. 
- for the amount of training I do, and the intensity I train at, I feel a little disheartened by the fact that I am getting similar scores to other people at bootcamp who don’t really put the extra time and work in and are a lot more ‘relaxed’ and uninvested in training. 
- my skills are there (muscle ups, HS walks, HSPU etc) but my engine is not there. 

Advice:
I’m trying to build my engine and I just can’t seem to improve it over the years. I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong. 
I’ve trialed programs like underdogs athlete, HWPO, PRVN etc and genuinely love them, they incorporate the conditioning pieces like Zone 2 and row intervals. I’ve really stuck with Underdogs. However I can’t commit to this AND bootcamp as I also work full time. 
I’m also looking at joining a CrossFit box to attend maybe once a week just to be amongst a group (I work ok on my own, and the programs allow me to spend 2-3 hours at a CrossFit gym). 

Question:
1) am I missing anything? Any reason why I can’t seem to get ‘fitter’ despite the intensity I train at and the consistency of it? 
2) should I join CrossFit classes at a local box or should I stick with the Underdogs program? 
3) I’m extremely loyal to the bootcamp as I’ve been there a long time and am close to the coaches. But are my goals unrealistic here? 

Thanks for your support guys!",submissions,crossfit

2,"Hi everyone,

Just curious if anyone has ever dealt with the aforementioned and how you managed to recover?

My initial injury happened about a year and a half ago. Took a lot of time off training, and basically went the meds (pain management?) route. It worked, and I was back to training after a few months. Never really did any exercises to strengthen my core/lower back and stabilising muscles. Just relied on meds (my bad). 

FFW to about 4 months ago. Started as a niggle, went into full blown agony and wasn’t even able to pick up my baby from his playmat or crib. 

I’ve attended 2 physio sessions and have been taking pain meds (disclaimer: I have a history with addiction and an intense dislike for any form of pill since being in recovery). However, the meds have helped me regain a lot of ROM and mitigated the pain a lot. Haven’t trained in over 3 weeks and although there is improvement I’m still in a bit of dark place due to not training and still being in pain (every so often I lapse in pain, iow, take a few steps back again). 

I am doing the movements to help the disc and pressure on my nerves. Can’t really say if they’re helping but willing to continue for as long as is needed so I can get moving again. 

The next step would be to see a specialist who will probably refer me for an MRI (expensive). However, even though I consider this every day, I feel like I need to be patient and give it more time. My doctor and physical therapist agrees. They are not too concerned as I don’t have any of the extreme symptoms. 

So yeah, any advice? The feeling of impending doom of having this pain, not being able to pick up weights, etc, is laying heavy on my mind and heart. Chronic pain is a bitch and worms its way into every single facet of thought and being. 

TIA.",submissions,crossfit

23.3 - did only 2 reps of 135lb snatches

I don't consider myself an average laidback gym goer but am rather competitive so I am not satisfied with these results.

60,"This was my first CrossFit Open and it was a super fun ride.    


I (late 30's Male - Been doing CrossFit for 6 months), took some time to reflect. For those who may be doing their first Open or those who have done an open so many times they forget what their first one is, here's a reflection from a first-timer.

23.1 - Scaled: 200 reps (in 14:37...didn't realize I was supposed to go back to rowing...doh!)  
23.2 - Rx: 95 reps  
23.3 - Scaled: 209 reps

**Emotions:**

* Humbling - Was humbled after 2-3 minutes into each of the workouts. Winded and thought I was more prepared.
* Fun / Exciting - Thoroughly enjoyed the Friday Night Lights and hearing the workout announced the day before.
* Nerve-wracking - Ensuring I followed the rules to a tee and strategies before the workout.
* Exhausted / Challenged - It was hard, I pushed myself, winded throughout.

**Here are some of my takeaways:**

1. There’s so much I don’t know about fluid barbell movements. Showcases that this is a long journey of learning.
2. I have another level of grit that I don’t access during weekly classes.
3. I don’t focus on &lt;15 min all-outs like I did these sessions.
4. This was a super fun break from normal programming - gave me an excuse to meet new folks.
5. I can’t imagine how hard this would have been if I didn’t do CrossFit. This was an excellent gauge of my actual abilities and provided a solid benchmark for following years (even though the activities are different).
6. There was a huge difference between scaled and Rx for some of the workouts (ex: 23.3)
7. There are a plethora of YouTube videos on strategies before going into the workout.
8. Was neat to chat about the workout with friends from other countries.
9. It boosted and revitalized my love and appreciation for CrossFit.
10. The CrossFit subreddit is super fun to follow and read along.

62,"I hate to be THAT person but…is it possible/allowed to do “single sets” of double unders? As in, just donkey kick the shit out it/jump really high and let the rope spin twice under you, then land, without keeping the rope spinning? 

I want to do RX, I can do the wall walks, but I can only even get “single single double single single double etc” once in a while. If I did this tomorrow, I would probably spend the entire remainder of the time only getting like 3 or 4 DU if I had to keep the rope spinning. Clearly, what I am proposing is not the most efficient (or pretty) thing, but for me or anyone else who sucks (truly sucks) at DU maybe this could be a way to accumulate reps rather than tripping the entire time?

For those wondering: 
I’ve been doing CrossFit for 6 months, have my own rope (buff cable)that is the proper length, practice nearly every day for 10+ min, but I still donkey kick the hell out of my double unders, and have only been able to do max 8 unbroken (they looked hideous/psychotic though). Most days the entire time I can only get like one or 2 double unders. I’ve videoed myself and while I have gotten slightly better about not using my arms as much, again, everything is still horrible. Single unders are fine, I can get 75+ unbroken no problem. I’ve done penguin taps until the cows come home, and frankly they really don’t help. Big single unders and consciously thinking “flick, flick, flick flick” has helped the most. But even then, it’s completely infuriating/embarrassing how bad I still am at these yet practicing almost every fucking day to still not even be able to get broken up double unders consistently.",submissions,crossfit
63,"I need help deciding on a jump rope.

I can do DUs; with my current one I can get like 10 or so at any workout (especially ones like 23.3) or maybe 25-30 fresh. Problem is I’ve been learning for the last year so my current rope is an Rx knockoff from amazon. The handles are super thick which really helped me learn how to feel the rope, and the rope itself is somewhat heavy so I could feel it better. 

I got it to learn but now I’ve learned. I know I can do more than where I’m currently at but since it’s so heavy my shoulders are on FIRE after just 10-20 reps. Then I watch others with less shoulder/arm strength and way worse cardio bang out like 50+ no problem. It’s been enough practice and I’m ready to move on to a speed rope now.

Kicking myself for not doing this before the open but better late than never. So is there a consensus? My friend uses the RPM rope and I really like it. The handle is great (I like it way more than my current thick one) and the lightweight is definitely a huge plus. Problem is that his is a hair too short for me so I can’t get an accurate feel. I’ve heard good things about others too, especially the elite srs ones. The difference between $35 and $70 isn’t that big of a deal for me personally, I’d rather just pay extra 30-40 to get one that works for me. Also, does anyone know what comp athletes use??

I noticed about a month ago some pretty significant soreness in my tibia, about halfway up, on the inside of my shin. It started after a workout that had a lot of toes to bar &amp; box jumps, though the pain was mostly felt when I would hop off the rig. 

The pain was initially fairly tolerable though the pain has gotten quite a bit worse. Admittedly, while I haven't missed a workout, I've had to favor my right leg during impact movements. Pain is mostly felt when I jump or hop down from the rig. I've been trying to practice dubs every day, but it was at a point this morning where I could hardly use my left leg.

I've been doing some research and it looks like stress fractures in the Tibia are relatively common amongst athletes, particularly on the inside / lower third.

If I assume that's what this is, I would imagine it would heal on it's own within 6-8 weeks of rest. I really don't want to take time off and lose progress.

I really do wish more people took this course, even if you have no plans to coach. Everything they taught you can use in your personal life. The workouts were awesome that we did.

144,"I had been doing Crossfit for about 18 months. Loved it. The Box, the coaches, the community. Competed (didn't do anything standout but gave it my all) in a few local events. I got overly confident and probably pushed myself too hard to be competitive on the boards for WODs. It was my 30th birthday. On top of the standard WOD, there was a birthday WOD. Do &lt;your age&gt; number of overhead lifts equal to your current weight. I was push pressing 170 and around the 8th rep, I heard my neck and shoulder pop. Likely tore something in my rotator cuff and subscapularis. Couldn't finish the workout.

Had also just started a new job a week afterward consulting. Traveling to and from Chicago frequently, so lots of time on airplanes and in hotel rooms. I constantly felt a molten ice pick driven into my upper right neck and subscapularis that were directly connected, down my right rotator cuff through my UCL. I couldn't turn my neck left or right, look up or down with feeling like those dueling stab points were threatening to tear a single thread holding my neck upright. Like it wanted to tear and detach my neck from the base of my skull. 

Getting out of bed in hotel rooms, it took me 10 minutes to finally lift my head off of my pillow. Because I knew I was fighting that single fiber connecting everything, on fire, in pain, to the breaking point when I'd get upright, sitting 90 degrees on the edge of the bed. I'd be in tears, walk myself in pain looking in one position, one direction, to the shower and put it on as hot as it could get. I'd stand there for 15 to 20 minutes letting it blast my neck and shoulder, numb to the heat, so I could loosen things up enough to get dressed.

6 months of this. Repeated massage therapists and chiropractors. Finally found a sports medicine guy that did dry needle electric stim therapy on me. 5 treatments over a month and a half. Into my lats, inner bicep muscles, triceps, all through my rotator cuff, subscapularis. It felt like micro Charley Horse cramps breaking out when he'd tap but it was the only thing that ultimately released all of the pain and get me as close to right as possible. I've been on a good run but I regularly reinjure it. Thankfully I'll go to a chiropractor and have a few treatment sessions to get it right so it only lasts 2 to 3 weeks at a time. Something as simple as drying my hair with a towel, sneezing and throwing everything out. There's some spinal problems in the upper neck as well from Crossfit.

Life changes. I'll be 40 this year. Became a first (and only, had my vasectomy yesterday) time father at the end of 2019, right when the pandemic hit. Might have some BHP. Will find out more when I follow up with my urologist. Take care of your health.",submissions,crossfit

I set a goal of making the quarterfinals after my first open last year where I finished in the 69th percentile.  I started doing crossfit during the final workout from the 2021 open and then started taking my training more seriously somewhere around September of 2021.  

It's been a mixed bag for me in this open.  I did well on the first workout but couldn't get a rmu in an actual workout after having gotten a few in practice.  I had a solid tie break time so it didn't kill me.  I expected to do better on 23.2a but really failed hard but luckily made up some ground with a very good b score where I finished within the top 5% worldwide for men (I'm trying to qualify for AGQF in the 40-44 range).  My score on b even ended up being in the top 1000 in my age group so I'm super happy about that.  

Overall, I am sitting in the 85th percentile with one workout to go.  I am hoping for something that is a sprint with some strength.  I can excel in those workouts more than I'm going to in a long cardio workout.  I don't think quarterfinals is a legitimate possibility this year but I'm currently 16% higher than I was last year and maybe a jump from 85% to 90% is more realistic than jumping from 69% to 90%.

172,"**tl;dr** 

The increased attention given to identifying and calling out video submission ""no reps"" is actually making the problem of questionable reps worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

This year more than ever, I've noticed an increased scrutiny on the official movement standards and the top-athlete's interpretation of those standards. Weirdly, I think this scrutiny is *incentivizing* top athletes to submit controversial videos that the community might notice, but not so controversial that the video would jeopardize the athlete's Quarterfinal qualification. 

**Reasoning (In general...)**

* Top athletes create YouTube channels to make money
* The more a YouTube video is watched; the more money it will make
* YouTube's algorithm will push videos that are clicked on (high CTR) and watched (high Average View Duration)

Given this, a top athlete can do the Open workout one of two ways: 

1. Pristine camera work, judging, and reps with a score high enough to proceed to the quarter finals.
2. Poor (but adequate) camera work, indifferent judging, and questionable reps with a score high enough to proceed to the quarter finals, or potentially win the event.

I argue that doing the workout the second way has more financial upside not just because of the increased chances of winning the event, but because of the perverse feedback loop it creates. 

For example, there is a chance that the video submission will be picked up by the CrossFit talking heads who will (purposefully or not) drive people who want to see the reps for themselves to watch the video. This type of video traffic, clicks and watch time, will improve how the YouTube algorithm perceives the athlete's channel; thus driving organic channel growth and monetization. 

The success of this no-rep strategy is based on the athlete's brand loyalty and how much the perception of submitting questionable reps matters, but the fact is that not enough people care enough to ostracize an athlete for submitting questionable reps and the scoring penalties aren't severe enough to prohibit advancing.

So unless the CrossFit Games does a better job nailing down movement standards\* and/or increases penalties for inexcusably poor videography; or the community shows more interest in discussing/watching workouts done well then workouts done poorly; the content-economy of analyzing and doing (!) questionable reps will only continue to grow.

&amp;#x200B;

\*A part of me thinks the CrossFit Games weaponizes this ambiguity purposefully to drive the free content and publicity. It's not uncommon in other sports to have a ref or governing body make controversial decisions that drive interaction without harming the popularity of the sport.",submissions,crossfit

234,"Background: 26M, 5’9” / 158lb, started crossfit last May after a ~7y break from HS. 

Doing my first open this year and having a blast. Nowhere near QF but really enjoying it. 23.1 (180) 23.2a (126) and 23.2b (185) for reference.

My cardio is okay but more running based than engine based; 5k is roughly 21-22min, but Cindy is only around 15-16, 23.a only 126. My strength is low, or at least much lower relatively. I want to get it high enough to consistently RX all workouts. Currently I can with most but some are just too heavy; mostly 70lb Dumbell workouts and anything involving heavy S2O. Or anything really heavy like DT (I did 135). 

My lifts are (on a good day) back squat (315) clean+jerk (210) and press (135). Not sure anything else is up to date by last time I did others was front squat (255) deadlift (335) push press (155) and bench (185) but those might be a hair higher now.

My goal is to consistently RX workouts, and be at least in the 50th percentile while doing it, ideally around the 75th percentile eventually. I will never compete at a high level, but I like the feeling of not struggling to RX and doing relatively good at my box compared to the other guys - mostly masters athletes but QF and even games level.

Now to the point: I want to (or feel like I should, I’m open to alternative suggestion) do more strength work outside of class. I have a standard gym membership as well so can do mostly any movement. Any recommendations? It appears that deadlift, back squat, front squat, strict press, and push press seem to be the most recommended lifts. But I also see a lot of suggestions for cable type work and even isolated machine work (hammy curls, etc).

### When you’re in the market for a mortgage, choosing the right broker is a critical decision.[ Mortgage brokers](https://www.lendinghub.ca/mortgages) like LendingHub.ca provide valuable services to homebuyers by connecting them with lenders and helping them secure the best possible mortgage rates and terms. Here are five things to consider when choosing a mortgage broker:

Experience and Reputation

1. One of the most important factors to consider when choosing a mortgage broker is their level of experience and reputation in the industry. Look for brokers like LendingHub.ca that have a proven track record of success and positive reviews from past clients.

Range of Services

1. Another important consideration is the range of services offered by the mortgage broker. Some brokers may specialize in certain types of mortgages, such as first-time homebuyer loans or investment property financing, while others may offer a broader range of options. Look for a broker like LendingHub.ca that can provide a wide range of mortgage products and services to suit your unique needs.

Fees and Commission Structure

1. Mortgage brokers typically charge a fee or commission for their services. Make sure you understand the broker’s fee structure upfront, including any fees or charges that may be associated with their services. Look for a broker like LendingHub.ca that is transparent about their fees and offers competitive rates.

Communication and Customer Service

1. The mortgage process can be complex, so it’s important to choose a broker that communicates clearly and provides exceptional customer service. Look for a broker like LendingHub.ca that is responsive to your inquiries and provides regular updates throughout the mortgage process.

Compliance and Regulation

1. Finally, make sure the mortgage broker you choose is compliant with all relevant regulations and guidelines. Look for brokers like LendingHub.ca that are licensed and registered with industry associations and governing bodies, such as the Canadian Mortgage Brokers Association.

In conclusion, choosing the right mortgage broker is an important decision that can impact your homebuying journey. By considering these five factors, you can make an informed decision and choose a broker like LendingHub.ca that will provide the expertise and guidance you need to secure the best possible mortgage rates and terms.",submissions,crossfit

Moving from Tokyo, Japan to Maryland this July, not quite sure where we'll be living but husband working around ft. Meade. Looking at the Columbia area for now.

I started CrossFit here in Japan, and did it for about 7-8 months obsessively (4-5 times a week) but then got pregnant, did absolutely no exercise, and still haven't really got back into exercise since the baby was born, though managed to lose all my baby weight and I'm really itching to get back onto fitness now that I'm out of the newborn baby haze.

I see Cove Crossfit, and actually reached out to ask about their childcare, which sounds great but I'm wondering if anyone can give me their experiences there or recommend other gyms to check out.

I'm definitely looking for a good, friendly community. I like seeing a variety of people at the gym, old/young, in shape/not in shape and just overall people excited about working out and supportive.

288,"**Tip 1: Long Strides**

Avoid losing time with short, choppy steps

Don't overstride at the expense of a good turnover

""jump"" the feet 180 degree to face the direction you want to go

prevent a loopy run path to minimize the distance you have to travel

**Tip 3: Prop on the Leg**

Use your hand or elbow to push off the leg in the turn

I'm truly interested to see where I stand against the rest of the world and I love the lack of barriers to CrossFit and competition, however, I'm a bit confused. Looking at the leaderboard, many seemed to have messed up their tiebreaker from 23.1. It looks like they put the time they had left after the cleans rather than the time they finished the cleans...

For example, saw someone who finished the cleans at 12:54 so they put a tiebreaker at 01:06. Does this error typically get resolved by Crossfit HQ? Or do I just need to deal with it?",submissions,crossfit

I’m just after some recommendations for at home programming, however it can’t involve lifts like the clean, jerk or snatch. I haven’t trained in those lifts and am not in a position to go get training at the moment.

I have a fully equipped gym with rack barbell, dumbbells, slam balls, wall balls, sled, kettlebells, weight vest, bands, and so on.

I am fine with variations of squat, OHP, bench, Dead etc.

I know of StreetParking and was considering combining that with Greyskull (one lift per day) to get some strength work in as I can still make some progress there. 

The other option I found was johnnie WOD, I can sub out one clean a week. However I wasn’t sold on the strength component of it as it doesn’t look consistent.

His score was validated by the owner.  

To reiterate, this guy has no shame and will literally no rep 40 wall balls if given the opportunity.  And don’t even get me started on his cleans.

321,"Hi folks,

I'm sure this is a question that's been discussed, but my search bar abilities are not turning up anything good.

I've recently restarted crossfit after a few years of a break. I used to go 4-5 times a week -- wasn't great at it, but handled the volume ok.

Since then I have gained weight, my cardio has gone to shit, but I have continued to lift on and off so my strength is ok-ish. I've been able to scale and finish workouts feeling not destroyed but distinctly worked (Whoop has measured my workouts as being in the 12-14 strain range).

I expected soreness trying to get back into it, but I didn't expect just overall impact. I feel overall completely wrecked and exhausted for *days* after a workout. I'm sleeping 8 or 9, sometimes 10hrs a night but wake up so tired that I feel like it was a 4-hour night. I haven't been able to maintain a deficit in my diet because it feels like my recovery would be even more shit if I did that even though that is a priority for me. 

I don't remember getting into crossfit workouts the first time around having quite such an impact, so I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to do. Is this common and I'll just adjust? Or is there something I could do to speed this recovery time up? I'd like to get to a point where I'm going 5 times a week again, but at the moment I'm getting maybe 2 with only one where I feel like I'm actually good to go into it.",submissions,crossfit

I’m gonna try to fit in glute-specific strength-training at home 3x a week but there’s gotta be something I can do *in* class to remedy this.

I’m eating plenty, hitting my macros daily, sometimes even going over them and overall calories, so it’s not a lack of fuel.

I'm following the competition track from PRVN now for Bit over 1,5 half year and I enjoy IT pretty much but since i want to train less and due to the Coach Switch im thinking of switching the programming.

I can do all movements but my GF started with cf around the time i started with PRVN. She improved quite fast and can do all except MU and hsw.

Usually, i was between lvl2-3 in PRVN. The weights more lvl2 then 3 but the scaling worked Out quite nice for me and my GF was between 1-2.

Since Shane Took over my GF often cant do lvl1 anymore Sometimes which is pretty frustrating and i Had to Go down as Well.

As we already thought about another programming thia might be the time to Switch.

So WE are looking for a programming for 5 days with 90- max 120 min one Session a day (excl. Warm-up).

I have somewhat decent level in CrossFit, I now compete in intermediate local comps and plan on doing RX's one next year.

I know part of it is my hands needing to ""toughen up"" and part grip strength. The best way to describe it is that if someone strapped my hands to the bar, or the bar was softer (like one of those home pull-up bars) I feel like I'd be able to do a lot.

For instance one guy got to the second round with 55 calories and put 14:00 mins as his Tie Break time (Should of been 8:35).  That would mean he finished his cleans at 14:00 and then did 20 RMU and 55 cals after the time cap.

**Tiebreak Rules**

 Time should be recorded after the completion of each set of **cleans**. When submitting a score, athletes will enter their total number of reps completed as well as the time at which they completed their last full set of **cleans**. In the case of a tie (athletes complete the same number of reps), the athlete with the lower tiebreak time will be ranked higher.

Also tens of thousands did not even get to the cleans and put in a tiebreak time when they finished the rower or toes to bar.  I know I know who cares right?

The [CrossFit worm](http://lasanisports.com/categories/view/crossfit-worm), also known as the team worm, is a piece of equipment used in CrossFit workouts for team events. It is a long, weighted training tool that resembles a worm and is usually made of rubber or vinyl material. The worm is designed to be lifted, carried, and passed between teammates during workouts, requiring coordination, communication, and teamwork.

The CrossFit worm typically comes in different weights, ranging from 160 pounds to 400 pounds, and can be used in a variety of exercises, such as squats, lunges, and burpees. It is a challenging piece of equipment to work with due to its weight and size, but it promotes team bonding and encourages athletes to push themselves beyond their limits.

The CrossFit worm is often used in CrossFit competitions, particularly during the team events, and has become a popular tool among CrossFit enthusiasts for its ability to challenge and develop different physical and mental skills.

 The [4-person worm](http://lasanisports.com/product/crossfit-worm-four-person) is a smaller version of the CrossFit worm, designed for teams of four athletes. It is typically used in CrossFit workouts and competitions, particularly for smaller teams or individuals who want to use it for training.  

**4 Person Crossfit Strength Training Worm**

A 4 person CrossFit Worm is a variation of the CrossFit Worm equipment that is designed for use by four people at the same time. This type of worm is typically longer and heavier than a single person worm, and it is used for team-based exercises such as pushing, pulling, and carrying. The four person worm is often used in group or team training sessions and competitions, as it requires coordination and teamwork to effectively use.

397,"Hey everyone,

I am currently looking for some help in finding some programming.  I have spent most of my last five to six years lifting weights and following powerlifting type lifting.  My main issue with that is that I never did much cardio and I always carried around a gut.  I moved onto Linchpin last year for about eight months then got burnt out and had to stop.  I was sore and felt like I was losing strength.  I tried lifting again but after jumping in a few workouts and walking around like I was an old man in his 80's, I'm 37 years old, I decided to jump back into crossfit/functional fitness.  This time around though I found it harder to stay on task and modify the workouts to be fun and something I wanted to do.  I enjoy the Linchpin programming but currently I can't maintain it.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what has changed in my life, but I have found myself having limited time and limited equipment options.  An example of my current life is I get home from work and pick up my kids and watch them until my wife gets out of work.  That is about an hour and the only time I would be able to squeeze in a workout unless it's a weekend.  Due to the kids I can't go to my home gym with a barbell and squat rack, so I'm limited to some cardio equipment and dumbbells.  I have a sandbag and a few kettlebells.  I have been looking around but can't find anything yet that sold me on what type of programing to go with.

My dilemma, as I'm sure many others have faced is that I'm probably between the two divisions. For those in similar position how did u decide which to do?

With Rx:  my TTB I can at most do 4 or 5 for 2 or 3 sets, my 14lbs wall ball a lot would be no reps by not throwing ball high enough, my Max clean is 45kg so 43kg after that work out will be tough, obviously don't have RMUs but don't actually expect to get there.

With Scaled: I can definitely do all of those things but the sheer volume will still make this a good workout. My goal would be to get through everything.

I just want an easy way to see the Open score submissions from famous Crossfitters. I followed a bunch of them on the official app, hoping that would generate some leaderboard of my ""followed"" athletes. But nope, it doesn't. 

If you go directly to a profile page for an athlete ([example](https://games.crossfit.com/athlete/591912)), it only shows their Open score from 2022 and before!

And finally, if you try searching for a famous athlete in the leaderboard athlete search box, the search results omit the person I'm looking for 90% of the time! (Try typing ""katrin davidsdottir"" into the leaderboard athlete search. You won't find the famous athlete.)

402,"""1 RX rep beats infinite scaled reps.""   
I saw this in a comment on the 23.1 thread. My question is ""Why?"". This is my 2nd Open, and I understand that this is always how the leaderboard works, but it goes against the usual rhetoric of most CF coaches and what I understand as the general ethos of CrossFit - that it's OK to scale and that you SHOULD scale to your ability level. 

Why should choosing to submit a scaled score punish you to this extent? It's a great idea to have ""separator"" workouts that tremendously reward the athlete that gets their first muscle-up, or fights through 10 dubs, or manages 2 or 3 handstand pushups. But when 1 calorie on the rower, submitted as RX, beats 300+ scaled reps, when the scaled athlete started his workout with 60 calories on the exact same rower, that's just ridiculous.   
   
In my opinion, I think that there should be a minimum work requirement of 61 reps on 23.1 in order to submit an RX score.",submissions,crossfit

416,"Polling the crowd here - Quick background: I (M/47) have been doing Crossfit for almost two years now, and use it as a strength training supplement to my road and trail running.  I typically go three times a week and really enjoy everything about it. More often than not, I do not achieve the Rx during these workouts usually due to my lack of core CF skills, i.e. kipping, toes to bar, handstand push ups, muscle ups, and dubs (although I am getting better and am starting to string them together).  Between work/kids/life/running other days, I typically show up, do the workout at 100%, wrap up the session with some core and then leave.

That said, I would love to learn these necessary skills to round out my practice.  It would be great to hear how others in my boat have tackled this.  With double-unders, as an example, I will practice before a work out and sometime after, but thats usually it.  Is the idea that I do the same with each of the above techniques?

I actually just train like a Crossfit Athlete. Further, I tend to out perform those around me when backcountry skiing or mountaineering who mostly subscribe to the above (albeit we are all weekend warriors, not actual pros).

506,"Alright, just ahead of the Open, I want some advice on this from people who have maybe had similar problems and have found solutions.

I am a fairly decent Crossfit athlete, and I would love to be top 500 in quarterfinals this year.  HOWEVER, every year there is at least one workout in the Open and in Quarterfinals that just completely blows up my back muscularly and I haven't found a protocol that has been able to prevent it. I know that my mobility isn't top tier, but I move FAIRLY well, although you can check my instagram at justanothergymaccount to critique movement if you doubt it.

My theory is that I have a slightly over-developed lower back, and therefore I have a hard time keeping it from firing when my hamstrings should be doing the work.  Things like low weight, high rep deadlifts and goblet squats will consistently blow it up, and if other posterior intensive things are combined with burpee box jumps, running, wall balls, etc, the same thing can happen. Don't even talk to me about suitcase deadlifts, back extensions, or dball carries. It feels like no matter how mindful I am of engaging my hamstrings and glutes, there comes a time that I simply cannot do the movement without engaging my lower back, which is frustrating.

**My pain:** When I say my back explodes, it's very muscular tightness that just increases until I struggle to move much at all. After a workout, it only takes 5-10 minutes for it to relax, and I basically feel fine for the rest of the day. I can be writhing on the ground in pain after a workout and the next day not even remember it happened.

**What I have tried:** I have tried doing an aggressive amount of hamstring, pigeon, and hip flexor stretching and mobility, with very little results. I did about 6 weeks of the McGill Big 3, and it actually seemed to make it worse, I began to have problems even sitting in my office chair the next day. I have tried very aggressive glute and hamstring warmups before workouts to try to get them firing correctly, with no results really at all.

**My question:** Has anyone here experienced this kind of back tightness to the point of having to stop workouts, and if so, have you found any kind of a solution?",submissions,crossfit

Going into it, I was #138 and I’m 5’8(f) for reference. I was *hoping* to get leaner and more toned and be #135 range. Here I sit at #143 now. I’ve cut out alcohol almost completely, increased protein intake to try and get 120-140g per day. I had a clean diet before (but lacked enough protein), but still made tweaks (ie opting for ways to sneak in protein instead of carbs using a macro tracking app, measuring out food or portion sizes more thoroughly, cutting back on unnecessary sweets).

I’ve had 3 “scans” done at a local health store showing the fat to muscle conversion so I KNOW the scale isn’t giving me the whole picture. But, I’m still a little disappointed that I put on 5lbs that seemingly are here to stay. I did take measurements, and they did change very slightly— but truthfully, I was pretty slim to begin with so I knew that by adding muscle, those measurements could increase as I toned up.

I uploaded this to the fitness and weightroom subreddits in the last couple weeks. While this most certainly isn't CrossFit, I think some people here might potentially glean one or two useful bits of information out of this mountain of text. 

# Introduction

I thought I'd share my multi-year journey to acquiring somewhat impressive pulling strength. I didn't keep perfectly organised training logs, one of my regrets looking back on it, but I loosely remember what I was doing, and when I was doing it, give or take, at least to give a somewhat accurate representation of my training up until now. For those expecting a clear-cut, structured path, this post won't be that. Instead, I simply meandered through the years, acquiring a hell of a lot of pulling volume, and eventually hit a rather decent milestone. Let's dive in.

# 2004

My earliest memory of some type of pull-up achievement, was 19 years ago. It was the year 2004, and I was a skinny 13 year old kid. No idea how much I weighed, or exactly how tall I was, but those figures don't really matter. We had some type of PE class, and we all went down to the rowing sheds. There were 2 trees next to said sheds, with a pull-up bar between. The teacher had us do as many reps as we could, and I got 10. I didn't get the most, but I was near the top, so obviously this felt pretty cool.

# 2009

Fast-forward 5 years to 2009, and I'm a skinny 18 year old. Maybe not as skinny as some, but not exactly big. I didn't really do any form of ***actual*** strength training. I played rugby, sprinted, swam etc. I'm not a particularly gifted athlete at all, I just liked being physically active. Around this time, I was around 6ft, 70kg/154lb. I messed around with bodyweight movements mostly. Lots of push-ups and pull-ups on one of those ***Iron Gym*** pull-up bars you attach to a doorframe. I could do a set of +/- 15 pull-ups at this stage.

***Training***

I did your traditional 3 sets of 8-12/15 reps of pull-ups, push-ups &amp; sit-ups, 3 times a week. I ran 5km about 3 times a week. I played school sport. That was the extent of my ""training"", and I use that word very loosely. It was more like exercise.

I was rather skinny, as you can see [here](https://imgur.com/jsT38oT) and [here](https://imgur.com/GAy8Mte).

# 2010-2011

I joined the gym on university campus, and sort of messed around with basic stuff. Your typical ""bro"" movements. Curls. Triceps extensions. Etc. I didn't really see a whole lot of improvement, but that's because I didn't put anywhere close to the required effort to see substantial improvement. I ate badly, I slept badly, and I went to the gym a few times a week, more just exercising vs actual training. Outside of this, I would run a few times a week, and still do some bodyweight stuff here and there. I don't know how many pull-ups I could do at this stage, but I doubt I had any significant improvement since 2009.

***Training***

I still followed your traditional 3 sets of 8-12/15 reps, but just added some barbell movements. Bicep curls. Triceps extensions. Bench press. Deadlift. Bent over row. I did this 3 times a week. I ran 5km, 3 times a week. While those movements and that format can elicit somewhat decent results, I didn't put in a whole lot of effort, and probably could have pushed much harder. Again, I'd hardly classify this as ""training"", it was more like general exercise.

# 2012-2013

I was living with my parents at the time. The university gym wasn't quite for me, and I was just messing around with bodyweight movements again. One day, I was chatting to my friend, a gymnast, and he lent me ***Christoper Sommer's*** book: ***Building the Gymnastic Body: The Science of Gymnastics Strength Training***. ***Sommer*** is a world renowned gymnastics coach for the US on various levels. I don't know why, but something just clicked, and this was what I wanted to be doing for training. So I bought a pair of gymnastic rings, hung them up outside on a tree branch above the driveway, about 4m off the floor. I started doing a bit more of a structured program. Lots of pull-ups, L-sits, dips etc. The book didn't exactly have training programs, more movement progression work etc.

***Training***

This was the first time in my training life, that I think I actually started to put in some form of real effort. I shifted away from the 3 sets of 8-12/15 reps, and moved towards going to just short of failure for 3 sets. On the rings, I did pull-ups, l-sit, dips, front lever tuck rows. I carried on doing push-ups to (somewhat) balance out all the pulling movements. I did this 3-4 times a week. I also ran 5km, 3 times a week. Basic movements, at adequate intensity, can yield decent results. This was far more efficacious than my previous ""training"".

# 2014

Training on rings was great, and at the time I was pretty happy with how things were going. My one university friend was getting quite into CrossFit, and suggested I give it a go, and sent me the link of a CrossFit gym in my town (there were only 2 at the time). I looked at some of the workouts, and it was certainly intriguing. Sleds, burpees, kettlebell swings etc. I thought why not, let's try it. In the first few weeks of being there, we tested our 1RM for pull-ups. I'd never done any form of weighted pull-up before, so that was completely new to me. I ended up having the top score in the gym, BW + 40kg/88lb. I was around 6ft1, and weighed about 75kg/165lb. Obviously this was a big confidence booster, and my training on rings had paid off a bit.

***Training***

I trained 5 times a week. Mon-Tue &amp; Thu-Fri were somewhat intense training days, Wednesday was active recovery. CrossFit classes consisted of a strength movement or two, and a metcon/conditioning piece. The formats for the strength movements could be anything from doing 4 sets of 10 reps at X percentage of your 1RM, all the way down to testing your 1RM. The metcon/conditionion, could be as short as 2 minutes, all the way up to 30+ minutes. CrossFit has hundreds of movements, so there was a lot of variety here, and each week was different to the next.

# 2015-2016

Fast-forward a year, and I've added... 3kg/7lb to my max pull-up. Something didn't seem quite right, that is very slow progress. Instead of going on YouTube like I should have, and searching for weighted pull-ups and seeing tons of guys lifting way more than I was lifting, I asked the CrossFit coach about it. He simply said well when you have high enough strength numbers, progress is slow. He is right in theory... just not about me. BW + 43kg/95lb is not exactly world-class pulling strength, so I shouldn't be progressing this slowly. What he should have said is, hey we mainly do kipping pull-ups here, not a whole lot of accessory work that would benefit strict pull-ups, so that's why you're progressing the way you are. I eventually left CrossFit, for reasons other than slow pull-up progression. I got a squat rack and barbell for home, still had my pair of gymnastic rings, and did some basic bodyweight movements again, on top of some squats, bench press etc. After doing this for a while, my pull-up 1RM improved to BW + 50kg/110lb. I hadn't really improved a whole lot, but I suspect this was due to a lack of effort, and perhaps not the best training decisions.

***Training***

I trained about 3 times a week. I did 5X5 on squats, deadlifts and bench press, each movement done once per week. For accessory work, I did dips, pull-ups and hanging leg raises, each once a week. I did these in the same format as 2012-2013, 3 sets to failure. I ran 5km, 3 times a week.

I looked like [this](https://imgur.com/IpIyjDs). My training and general nutrition wasn't particularly where it should be, and this photo kind of shows that.

# 2017

I happened upon ***Chris Heria*** of ***Thenx***. He gets a bit of hate for his tattoos (among other things), but he had impressive feats of calisthenic strength, he had a huge amount of well-produced videos on YouTube, and he had a training app that was clean and easy to use. I thought what the hell, let's do this. I followed his beginner program for about a year, and in that year, I didn't touch any weights. Not a barbell, not a dumbbell, not a weight vest or dip belt, nothing. The program included copious amounts of pull-ups and all of its regressions, stuff I'd never even considered doing. If my 1RM pull-up is BW + 50kg/110lb... why would I do negatives, jumping pull-ups, ring rows etc? I was an idiot. You can never do enough of the basics. I don't know exactly how many pulling variation reps I did over that year, but it must have been in the thousands. Maybe even tens of thousands. Some workouts would have you do stuff like 3 pull-up sets to failure, and I got 60+ reps across those 3 sets. Then you did some other pulling movements in the same workout, similar format. Some workouts ended up having 200+ repetitions of pulling movements, just a lot of volume.

***Training***

If I thought I was putting in decent effort in 2012-2013, this blew that out of the water. ***Thenx*** workouts were rough. I'll just list one of the pull-focused days:

***3 rounds:***

* 4 X Pull-ups (Wide, Shoulder Width, Close Grip)
* Max Reps: Jump Negative Pull-Ups
* 5 X Australian Pull-Ups (Wide, Shoulder Width, Close Grip)
* Max Reps: Commando Pull-Ups
* 10 X Bar Curls
* 12 X Hanging Leg Raise
* 15 X Hanging Knee Raise

As you can see, in just one round of that, you are amassing a hell of a lot of pulling volume. 3 rounds, it was ridiculous. I did similar workouts for pushing and leg movements too, lots of different movements, a ton of reps. You'd see a pulling workout, like the above, 1-2 times a week. And then some other workouts sometimes included a bit of pulling movements too.

I did ***Thenx*** workouts 4-5 times a week, and ran 5km, 3 times a week.

At the end of 2017, I looked like [this](https://imgur.com/l6rc0LJ). This was by far the best I'd ever looked and felt. A product of high effort in training, and for the first time in my life, actually eating according to a plan. I was eating around 2500 calories a day, decent amounts of protein, and quite lean. 

# 2018 - March 2020

After that year of ***Thenx***, I found myself able to hold an l-sit for over a minute, I could do 30 pull-ups unbroken etc. But if you asked me to squat 100kg/220lb, I'd probably have struggled. While I was thoroughly enjoying ***Thenx***, I needed a change. I needed some barbell movements again, as well as BW movements. Before taking a pivot in training direction, I tested my 1RM pull-up. I got BW + 70kg/154lb, and I weighed around 75kg/165lb. That was a bit mind-blowing, given I hadn't touched a weight in over a year. All of that BW pulling volume from ***Thenx*** must have paid off. Never did I think I could be approaching a 2X BW pull-up. 

My training shifted to a somewhat CrossFit-esque model, just without kipping movements, snatches etc. I started doing squats, weighted pull-ups, farmers carries etc. Metcons/conditioning where ***quality*** was the goal. Rather get 3 rounds and move well, vs 4 rounds and move badly. My weighted pull-up strength work consisted of working up to a heavy 3-5 reps for the day. Over this period, I got my pull-up 1RM up to BW + 77kg/170lb. I weighed around 80kg/176lb, so I could almost do a 2X BW pull-up.

***Training***

I was training 3 times a week, and running 5km, 3 times a week. My training in the gym was similar to 2014. Strength movement or two, followed by metcon/conditioning. Lots of different movements, lots of variety. I did strict pull-ups/bent over row/front squat/back squat/bench press for strength, working up to a heavy 3-5 reps, once every 2 weeks. I did a lot of different pulling movements in the metcons/conditioning, of quite different formats. Something like 21-15-9 pull-ups and Erg for calories, which was very quick. Or something like AMRAP 20: 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, 15 air squats, where you amass a lot of pull-ups. So I was doing some form of pull-ups, whether it be for strength, or for metcon/conditioning, twice a week at least.

After this training period, I looked like [this](https://imgur.com/3RSs49l).

# March 2020 - August 2021

Yeah... Covid happened. That turned my life upside down, as it did to many others. Without getting into too much detail, during this time I was separated from my wife and newborn daughter for 17 months (I was in South Africa, they were in Vermont, US). Safe to say, my training took a bit of a nosedive.

# August 2021 - June 2022

I finally got to Vermont in August 2021, reuniting with my family. Training resumed, and I was able to get some consistency again, getting my pull-up back to BW + 77kg/170lb relatively quickly. I just worked up to heavy singles, doubles and triples, and hit accessory work hard. I also started doing ring pull-ups vs bar pull-ups. I'm in my late 30s, rings are arguably better for the shoulder, and the movement just feels great. It's not quite a pull-up, but not quite a chin-up either, your grip just shifts throughout the movement. I tested my 1RM, and it was BW + 73kg/161lb. I weighed around 82kg/181lb. So a bit less than my bar pull-up, but that didn't particularly bother me.

***Training***

My training here was very similar to my 2018-2020 training. Only real difference was, I worked up to heavy singles, doubles and triples. Otherwise, format and frequency was much the same.

# July 2022 - February 2023

I started following ***5/3/1*** around July 2022, as I was curious about how it would work with something like pull-ups. AMRAP sets at submaximal loads sounded interesting, and not something I'd ever really done before. I think my body responded well to all the volume of heavy pulling, and I got my ring pull-up to [83.5kg/184lb BW + 92.5kg/204lb](https://www.reddit.com/r/strength_training/comments/10ss5yt/ring_pullup_835kg184lb_bw_925kg204lb/). For anyone who wants to do pull-ups within the context of ***5/3/1***, it is certainly doable, as long as you have a high enough 1RM where the %s make sense.

***Training***

I modified ***5/3/1*** quite a bit. Traditional ***5/3/1*** has you doing squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press, once a week each. You go relatively heavy on these, usually for at least 5+ reps. You also typically do some supplemental work with the same lift, at a lighter load.

I chose the ***Coffinworm*** variant, which is Jim Wendler's version of wave training. A pull-up day would look like this:

***Warmup:***

* 5 reps @ 40% of TM
* 5 reps @ 60% of TM

***Wave 1:***

* 5 reps @ 70% of TM
* 5 reps @ 80% of TM
* 5 reps @ 90% of TM

***Wave 2:***

* 5 reps @ 80% of TM
* 3 reps @ 90% of TM
* AMRAP @ 100% of TM

I would do the above, once a week. Besides pull-ups, I did the same format, for Larsen presses, and front box squat. Unusual movements for ***5/3/1***, but it suited my goals. 

***Coffinworm*** has you pushing heavy for 2 weeks, then taking a mini-deload in the 3rd week. I just did this 3 week cycle, rinse and repeat.

For accessory work, I did each of the following, once a week:

* PureTorque (EMOM 6: 30s)
* Hanging Leg Raise on rings (AMRAP 5)
* 2 rounds: 1 Min Echo Bike +  KB Row (AMRAP 3) &amp; 1 Min Erg + Archer Push-Up (AMRAP 3)
*  Nordic Curl (EMOM 5: 5 negatives)
* Kneesovertoesguy Movements (KoT Calf Raise, ATG Split Squat, Poliquin Step-Up, Reverse Squat, Tibialis Raise, QL Side Bend, Back Extension). 2 rounds, 10 reps of each.

My accessory work was always the same, regardless of whether I was in a heavy, or deload week, for the main 3 lifts I chose.

On 3 of my 4 off days, I'd do active recovery, instead of taking completely off. My active recovery took the form of: 

5 min stations:

* Walk w/ Weight Vest
* Sled Push/Drag
* Echo Bike
* Erg

Regarding leader/anchor cycles... I kept it simple. I just did anchor cycles, which are very similar to leader cycles, you just PR the final set of the 2nd wave, instead of going to a fixed weight. 

To amalgamate all of the above, a training week looks like this:

* Mon - 5/3/1 (Pull-Ups) + Accessory (PureTorque &amp; Hanging Leg Raise)
* Tue -  Active Recovery 
* Wed - 5/3/1 (Larsen Press) + Accessory (Echo Bike + KB Row &amp; Erg + Archer Push-Up)
* Thu - Active Recovery
* Fri - 5/3/1 (Front Box Squat) + Accessory (Nordic Curl + Kneesovertoesguy)
* Sat - Active Recovery
* Sun - Rest 

[This](https://imgur.com/1M55ZGW) is what I currently look like. Perhaps leaner than I was during my ***Thenx*** days, and 8.5kg/19lb heavier. Definitely feels better being pretty much as lean, weighing more, and eating nearly 1000 calories more than 2017. I have come a long way from that skinny 18 year old, 14 years ago.

# Conclusion

I achieved something I didn't think possible, at least for me. There are some monsters out there lifting far more, but for a former skinny kid, not exactly blessed with the best genetics from an athletic POV, this was a truly satisfying milestone to hit. Could I have done it in far shorter time with a more structured approach, more weighted pull-up work earlier on, adequate effort from the start etc? Sure. But that's not how it played out.

I sort of view what I did, as some tend to view Tom Brady, or Jerry Rice etc. ***""Longevity Award""*** is a term I've seen tossed around. They have accumulated stats and records that might never be broken, just because of the sheer amount of years they played, which is impressive by itself. Nevermind the Superbowls and MVPs etc. I don't view labelling their freakish stats as ""longevity awards"" an insult, if anything, that's a compliment to how they were able to last so many years in a professional league, implying they were still playing at a decent level into their older years.

Now I'm not comparing myself to 2 NFL legends, but this notion of a ""longevity award"" is sort of how I view this ring pull-up. I certainly didn't have the most efficacious training. I didn't make the most of my time. I didn't always train with the intent and effort that I should have. But I ***did*** stick with it over the years, where others may have simply just stopped, and the end result is a somewhat impressive ring pull-up. I think many people could achieve this feat, if they just stuck to it, but a pull-up is not exactly high up on the list of things people try to improve, vs a squat, bench, deadlift etc. I don't want to diminish this achievement, I'm quite proud of it, but at the same time, I'm quite aware that this is simply an unusual movement to pursue to the degree that I have. I'm proud of my ***perseverance***, vs some of the training decisions I made.

Happy to answer any Qs on any of the above, I can get as specific as my memory will allow.

# FAQ

1. ***Why do you call it a ""ring pull-up""?*** That's just what I know this movement as, as do most gymnasts I've spoken to. A ring pull-up is where your grip starts pronated, and shifts throughout the movement. It's a mix of different grips. I've seen it referred to as a ring chin-up as well. If we want to get into semantics, then neither term is technically correct. My bar pull-up is about the same as my ring pull-up.
2. ***Why do you start with your feet on the floor?*** 2 parts to this answer. My wife is shorter than me, and if I put the rings any higher, she'd need to get a step or something and jump to reach the rings. The more important answer, however, is that over the years, I've found that this is just more convenient for doing waves of strength work. You can also brace better. My numbers are around the same if I hang at the start, and if streetlifting ever finds it's way to Vermont, I'll do that at the competition, as that's the standard.
3. ***Why!?!?!?*** This usually refers to why would I put so much time into an unconventional strength lift. Honest answer, is that it's based on how my first strength training experience went. I couldn't compete on squats or deadlifts or cleans etc, but I could beat everyone on pull-ups. I got compliments from bigger guys, which I'm sure many here can appreciate how great that feels. I just stuck to what I was relatively decent at, and over the years, have achieved a somewhat impressive amount of pulling strength.
4. ***Why don't you use chalk or wrist wraps?*** I personally like doing the movement clean, without assistance. Just my personal preference.
5. ***Why do you use a dip belt and weight vest?*** Personal preference, I like splitting the weight up a bit. In a perfect world, I'd somehow have a suit that distributed the weight evenly across my entire body, but such a thing doesn't exist. So I went for a combo of a dip belt + weight vest.
6. ***What brand dip belt/weight vest do you use?*** [Hypeletics Weighted Dip Belt](https://hypeletics.com/product/hypeletics-weighted-dip-belt/) &amp; [Kensui EZ Vest (Pro V2 Model)](https://kensuifitness.com/products/kensui-ez-vest). Most comfortable dip belt and weight vest I've ever worn, and it's not even close.
7. ***Aren't weighted pull-ups of X weight dangerous?*** I use X here, because I've heard this question a few times, X being a range of numbers, sometimes as low as 20kg/44lb. Not exactly sure where this notion came from, but in my anecdotal experience, no, weighted work past a certain amount is not inherently dangerous.
8. ***Can you do a one-armed pull-up?*** This question somewhat baffles me, because you could do a one-armed pull-up with ***far*** less pulling strength. So the answer is yes.
9. ***Can you do a bar muscle-up?*** Same answer as #7.
10. ***Can you do a front lever?*** Yes. In fact, I managed to attain a OAP, bar muscle-up and front lever, without actually working on them specifically. It was just a byproduct of increasing my pulling strength.
11. ***How do you deal with fluctuating BW?*** I weigh myself before pull-up workouts. If I weigh 1kg/2lb more, I add 1kg/2lb less to the dip belt/weight vest. The total amount of weight lifted (bodyweight + additional weight) is what matters.
12. ***What's your diet currently like like?*** I eat generally healthy foods. 3400 calories, 210g protein a day.
13. ***What's next?*** Given I don't particularly want to lose weight, 400lb total weight will come first. And then BW + 100kg/220lb additional weight. If I ever achieve that, I'll be on cloud 9, and anything more is just icing on the cake. I'll probably test this movement again at the end of 2023.",submissions,crossfit

Eventually, got more into running, particularly trail running, and now I mostly just lift to stay injury free for that.

I'd like to do CF maybe twice a week while training, and just focus on more sport specific running strength training on non-CF days. Is it even worthwhile to go twice a week? I plan on doing more like 3x a week when not actively training for a race. Doing about \~35-40MPW right now and trying to ramp that up to peak around 60-65 MPW, so that's already a big time commitment that requires a lot of recovery.

FWIW, I don't really care about being particularly good at Crossfit. I more so just want to increase my general fitness and meet people.",submissions,crossfit

Hi everyone,

I want to get started with CF and need a little guidance from some more experienced folks.    

As I’m new to CF I want to follow a workout plan. After searching around online I came across this:

https://www.thisiswhyimfit.com/4-week-crossfit-workout-plan-with-pdf/

To me this looks like a well thought out plan but I was wondering what you think. Further I will be doing this at my home gym where I have the essentials but things like rope climbs or muscle ups are going to be a problem. How do you guys compensate for that at home?

774,"Owners / managers, bear with me here - hoping for some feedback from you. 

Background, the original owners of my gym were a married couple who got divorced about 10 years ago. A handful of couples came together and bought the gym to “keep it alive”. The new owners were older and this was NOT a source of income, but basically an effort to break even and keep the community afloat.

I’ve been doing CrossFit for about 6 months. Before CrossFit, I was doing f45 and applied to open a gym. I was approved but didn’t move forward because I didn’t like the territories that were available. 

My heart has always been in helping others improve fitness. The owners of our gym are all in theirs 50s. I am potentially interested in taking over the gym within the next decade if they want to retire. How do I let them know? What do I need to know beforehand? Money/time isn’t an issue for me.

777,"Hey guys. I've noticed recently that I've been getting a lot of comments from fellow athletes in regards to my choice of weights on the barbell.

For example, yesterday's strength was Push Jerks. I was building to my 1 RM (125#) and I started to lose proper form so I decided not to hit a PR and just stop at my 1RM. I have been told many times over the past few weeks specifically, that I ""could go heavier"". Wether it's snatches, cleans, jerks etc. This comment always confuses me because I'm not sure if it's based on how I look (toned ish) or if you can actually tell if someone can actually lift more?

I know when I'm struggling and when I'm starting to lose form so how could I 'look' like I could go heavier?

I also get skinny shamed a lot by that same group of people which is contradictory tbh. If I'm so scrawny how could I do heavier weights? Am I missing something?

I know my numbers are underwhelming but I've never done any kind of sport ever up until doing CrossFit. I also used to be overweight (300#+) for most of my life.

I am 27/M/175lbs/5'11
1RMs:
Back squat: 180#
Front squat: 150#
Overhead squat: 100#
Bench press: 130#
Push press: 100#
Deadlift: 235#

My snatches SUCK. Failed/bailed at least once every time we had snatches for strength.

828,"Hi. 

I created an fitness app called Ardor. It creates workouts and programs that are based a lot on CrossFit methodology. One of the things it does is allow you to create workouts and programs your way, based on what you have, when you can workout, and what your interests/weaknesses are.

But this post is focusing on its main feature: **predicting not just how strong you are or what your bodyweight ability is but also, and what I believe is a first for fitness apps, making predictions about your overall fitness**. How fast you are, what’s your aerobic capacity like, when will your muscular stamina fail, etc.

I trained Ardor how to make metcon style workouts on an individual basis but then also predict when that individual will finish or how many rounds they can do within a time domain. I know, it sounds like a gimmick and seems unrealistic to measure or predict. Usually you need a ton of data behind other people’s results like the Open workouts. But there is a lot of machine learning applied in the backend of Ardor based on similar stuff I was doing at my last gig in big tech. 

**Ardor looks and tracks your ability on a per exercise basis**, considers what happens when you mix exercises together, how rests play a part, factors how intensity changes when you use a certain weight, when you need to scale exercises to hit a target stimulus, and separates aerobic and anaerobic capacity estimates. Handles 400+ bodyweight, weightlifting, and cardio exercises that can be mixed together in any combination of picking 2-5 exercises, 5-25min in length, and applying varying rep schemes.

The end result is, if you come in faster or slower than it predicts, it turns internal dials by finding patterns between how you did with previous workouts vs today, and then adjusts the very next workout it had planned so that it gets more accurate going forward. The interesting thing here is it **essentially unlocks this ability to compete against yourself on a daily basis since the workouts and goals are entirely based on how you did in the past**. Which we think is neat since this still works for workouts no one has ever done before and were created just for you and your level.

We’ve tested this with about 100 people within our circle and have found that most people typically fall within 5% accuracy of its predictions after just 3 workouts. 

What I’d like to do next is test this with a bigger pool of people to prove it works in the wild. We've seen apps that predict what weights people should use, or what pace they should aim for on monostructural exercises. But I don’t know of anyone who has been able to make predictions like this for the metcon/HIIT/fitness communities so.

If you are interested in seeing if it actually works (or trying to prove it wrong :)), you can install and try it out on iOS for free (Android coming soon). It comes with a free trial of 2 weeks but I added the promo code: “metcon” that you'll need to enter before the trial is up and that will extend the trial to 4 weeks so you have more time to kick its tires without needing to subscribe to anything (starts at $5.99 usd / month for those interested in the price after the trial). **All I’m asking is for some feedback**. Mainly:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Did the first 3 conditioning/metcon workouts get progressively more accurate?
2. After your first 3, did you find that the predictions were pretty accurate and give you a good goal to aim for every workout?
3. Did you try any of the strength based workouts and were the weights and reps there accurate too?

For CrossFit folks, the “Advanced Conditioning” focus will be the most familiar. “Conditioning” focus is similar but does not include any technical olympic or gymnastics work.

To learn more, see here: [https://www.ardor.fitness/coming-from-cross-func-fitness](https://www.ardor.fitness/coming-from-cross-func-fitness)

You can reach me at jlund@ardor.fitness anytime. 

So far every feature I’ve added has been community driven from folks using it, requesting things they would personally like. I would like to keep that going at scale.

Thanks,

I looked online and I’m confused if my pain is Tricep Tendonitis or is it Tennis Elbow / Cubital Tunnel. My pain started 10 days ago - I pinched a nerve in my low back and had to lie down in bed for few days to rest. While I was resting in bed, I was spending many hours throughout the whole day holding up my cell phone reading and watching video - as you can see in this picture link this was the exact position with my elbows flexed and raised.  

Link to picture with reading on phone position:

https://postimg.cc/5Ym7b6PV

After a few days of reading on my phone in this position, I started having a lot of pain on the backside above my elbow as you can see in the picture link I circled the exact location. And now I’m not able to read on my phone in this position anymore because the pain gets worse and unbearable. Another thing is the inside of my palm started hurting and feeling sore, probably from gripping the cell phone for too long.  

Link to picture with elbow pain location:

https://postimg.cc/yJgSXtq3

After reading online, it seems like this might be tricep tendonitis and not tennis elbow / cubital tunnel? However, I’m confused because after researching, tricep tendonitis is caused with the arms in extension, but as you can see in the picture, my arms were flexed most of the time and I don’t think I was engaging my triceps?

903,"Hi, I'm from a European country and at my club we are talking quite  a bit about moving away from the Australian technique with a long pause at the finish towards a stroke with a very quick turn around at the back and a slower slide recovery. The argument is that the Australian stroke only works if your catch is razor sharp, and that if it is, you can win milliseconds, but if its not, you can lose seconds. Therefore, for starting rowers, they say that its better to learn a stroke with a quick turn around allowing for a slower slide recovery, which doesnt slow the boat down as much by shoving it. This, also very importantly, allows you to reach a higher rate easier. This last argument applies extra to lightweights. The thought is that if rowers start approaching international level, becoming eligeble for the National Rowing federation, they can start changing it up to more fit their criteria.

I started working out at a CrossFit gym in my neighborhood about a year and a half ago. I really loved it. The coaches at the time were awesome and really supportive and focused on form. I felt part of an athletic community for the first time in my life (I’m near 40).

Recently we got a new coach that I’m not really jiving with. He seems super friendly and chatty with other folks but mostly cold toward me. He seems to give a lot of feedback to the other athletes but hasn’t given me one piece of feedback and it’s been like a month since he started. One day he even neglected to write my name on the board. It’s silly for me to care but I do. :)

 It sucks because now I think twice before going to work out when I see he’s coaching. And he mostly coaches at times that are convenient for me.

974,"As a marketing geek I just feel like I need to call this now. I mentioned this few month ago but now after wodapalooza I’m pretty damn confident that the RAD ones will become the new NoBull in the CrossFit community (and soon maybe to skaters as well (as a skater and crossfitter I’m pretty hyped for this)) and soon everyone will have or be willing to sell their sole for a pair. I can already see them popping up more in this sub.  

I know that TYR and Strike Mvmnt have also came onto the scene but imo Rad is already way ahead of them in terms of innovation and they’re “re-breaking” the “for us by us” mold that NoBull built from the Reebok and Nike giants. 
  
For $150USD, the shoe itself is actually pretty damn fantastic in all the aspects of lifting, running, longevity, and CrossFit in general. They don’t really have any off the wall colors that are dragging people to them. They’re pretty basic in terms of that aspect. However, they’re marketing with a “fuck the system” (queue the Danielle Brandon Energy) attitude and tapping into the nostalgia with the millennials and also new generations. On top of that they’re selling based on exclusivity for each color-wave with specified times every drop and no restock. These factors alone are driving their business like madness. 

Anyways, if you have a pair already let me know your thoughts on the shoe. If you haven’t heard of them or haven’t snagged a pair yet why not? (I missed out on a drop or two now but still have managed to snag a couple myself)",submissions,crossfit

1000,"I do. I suffer from Exceptionalism Disorder. And I think it's more prevalent among people doing CrossFit than general population, for reasons that link to why we do CrossFit in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Exceptionalism Disorder?** A condition where the sufferer has a pressing need that everything he or she creates must be exceptional, unique and better than anything else done in that area.

Note: this is my definition. This disorder does not exist in any medical or psychology manuals as far as I know. But I believe it’s a real issue and giving it a name helps. Naming things is the first step for us to deal with them. Also it is different from entitlement (which can also be called exceptionalism). It's about seeing yourself as special because of what you do, not because of who you are.

Examples of Exceptionalism Disorder in real life:

A student suffers from Exceptionalism Disorder. She has to write a book report. Instead of just writing it in two hours, she spends two weeks obsessively researching the book, what constitutes great literature critique and how one can disrupt conventional storytelling. She will turn in a half-finished unique report that gets a C because the teacher finds it chaotic and unstructured.

A knowledge worker suffers from Exceptionalism Disorder. He has to prepare a report on Q1 performance for this bosses. Someone without the condition would have taken the previous report and updated the data. He does not. He works day and night to create the best Q1 performance report ever, merging the usual data with macroeconomic context, business theory, consumer trends and disruptive ideas how the company could exceed all KPIs in the next quarter. His boss tells him the board does not have time for all of this, and only shows them two slides with the basic data.

A regular person just starting Cross-fit suffers from Exceptionalism Disorder. Regular people learn as they participate in the group classes. Not him. He does private training to learn the technical movements years ahead of the curve. He goes to the group training classes, and then spends as much time working out alone on strength and aerobic capacity. He either skyrockets to the top 10% in the box or fails from over exhaustion in the first year.

**Is this perfectionism?**

No. Although they are related.

“Have no fear of perfection – you’ll never reach it.” – Salvador Dali

Perfectionism definition: 1. any of various doctrines holding that religious, moral, social, or political perfection is attainable. 2. a personal standard, attitude, or philosophy that demands perfection and rejects anything less.

Perfectionists work to make things perfect, to make them conform to an imaginary norm of how they should be.

Exceptionalists work to make things exceptional, to make them stand out, unique and different than the norm.

Perfectionism is about perfect adherence to the norms, while exceptionalism is about extraordinary breaking of the norms.

In a sense perfectionism is the extreme of conformism, while exceptionalism implies unconformity. But it does not completely reject the norms, so it’s not actually the opposite of perfectionism.

“If you look for perfection, you'll never be content.” ― Leo Tolstoy, Anna Karenina

That being said, there is a big commonality between the two. Both seek validation from others. Perfectionists through perfect conformity. Exceptionalists through what they consider is more value than anyone.

Because they seek social validation by following ideals, they tend to create anxiety. Can you ever make anything perfect? No. Can you make anything exceptional? Yes, but it’s a subjective evaluation with standards that can always increase.

**Is Exceptionalism Disorder bad?**

On one hand obviously yes. It’s easy to push your standard for what is exceptional higher and higher, and never reach it. And because the standard is by definition high, there is always anxiety about not reaching it.

On top of that, it often leads to never finishing. It’s easy to try to always improve. You can search forever for an even better, brilliant, innovative way to do anything.

On top of that, it’s getting harder to be exceptional. When the world was local because we did not have Internet and mass communication, being exceptional meant standing out compared to people in your physical proximity. You could be exceptional by being the best at something in your small town. Or in your school, or company.

Now that the world is connected, it is not enough to be locally exceptional.

You might be worlds better at basketball than anyone in your school, but you are mediocre at best against the best in the country or the world. The same applies to any skill or activity. It’s incredibly hard to be exceptional at anything when you compare yourself with all the people in the world. But that does not meant that you are not exceptional at it.

On the other hand, Exceptionalism Disorder can be beneficial.

You are much more motivated than non-sufferers to create exceptional things. Most of the most successful people in the world probably suffered from Exceptionalism Disorder. Rarely can you achieve extraordinary results without investing unreasonably large amounts of time and effort.

**What causes Exceptionalism Disorder?**

Need for status meets Creator Economy &amp; Hustler Culture

At the core is a need for social status. We are social animals, we all need belonging and status in our tribes. What differs is how we go about achieving them. Exceptionalism sufferers’ approach is to gain social validation by creating more value than others. They try to do this by creating exceptional things or doing activities at an exceptional level.

In Exceptionalism Disorder, admiration is the path to social belonging and status.

This is often dependent on others’ validation. You want other people to read the exceptional novel you write.

But it can become internalized. You can strive for admiration while never showing your work to anyone. It’s the admiration you imagine when what you create meets the standards you set for exceptional.

I don’t know for sure what causes Exceptionalism Disorder in some people and not others.

If I were to guess, I would say it has to do with the models of social validation one is exposed to as a child. Children who did well in school and got validated for it by both teachers and parents are more susceptible. But I think it also needs an element of rebelliousness, of non-conformity, however it may arise. Otherwise you only get perfectionism.

**How do you treat Exceptionalism Disorder**

First, I don’t think you should aim to eliminate it if you have it. It’s a critical part of actually doing extraordinary things.

Take that with a grain of salt. I am biased. I clearly suffer from Exceptionalism Disorder which influences my value system. 

You can and should manage Exceptionalism Disorder. The key is to avoid the most negative effects: failure to meet deadlines, workaholism, chronic anxiety, inferiority complex/ superiority complex, avoidance of challenges.

**Strategies to manage Exceptionalism Disorder:**

**Do some things at a mediocre level or even badly**

A big problem is when you try to be exceptional at everything. You cannot and you exhaust yourself trying.

What you can do is be exceptional at one or two things. If you focus on those, it’s realistic to be great.

This does not mean you have to be awful at everything else. It just means you should not care that much how good you are.

I want to be an exceptional writer. But I find myself getting drawn into trying to be exceptional in everything else I do also. I get swept up in wanting to be the best at Crossfit, trail running, marketing strategy, board games with friends, and so on. Investing time in improving in these will detract from my ability to write exceptionally. A common example is if I push exceptionally hard in my morning Crossfit workout, I am too tired throughout the day to write exceptionally.

A characteristics of Exceptionalism Disorder is you find yourself competing in everything with high involvement.

Make yourself be mediocre at some things. And sit with that feeling. Don’t try to justify it away or vow to do better or anything like that. Just wait it out. This builds into acceptance of not being exceptional at everything.

**Set deadlines for projects**

Another risk with this disorder is to never finish. You can prevent this by setting hard deadlines for any project at the start.

Say you take on knitting because you want to knit a sweater to your grandma as a present. Set a hard deadline when this sweater has to be finished. Otherwise you might find yourself restarting it over and over as you get ideas how to make it even more exceptional.

**Set clear conscious realistic expectations**

For things where you do want to be exceptional, it helps to set realistic expectations from the start. Otherwise you will unconsciously compare yourself with everybody else doing that activity, including the best in the world.

If you start Crossfit for example, you should talk with your coach about what you should realistically expect to achieve in a year. Otherwise you will compare yourself with people at the box who might have been doing it for a decade. And even with athletes at the Crossfit games. You will not match those people as a beginner. You will fail and injure yourself in the process.

**Importance matrix for big undertakings**

When you take on a big project that is important to you, you want to make it exceptional. The problem is that the more important the project, the more likely it is you never finish because you get bogged down in trying to achieve everything.

For example say you are preparing a big presentation at work. It’s easy to try to make it exceptional from all regards: have all the data, the best aesthetics, innovative visuals, mind-blowing insights, and so on. However this is impossible. You cannot do everything.

In such cases you need to prioritize. Determine what are the aspects which matter most and which are less important. For example for the presentation maybe the mind-blowing insights matter more than the visuals and having absolutely all the data.

You can use an importance matrix to determine which are these aspects. Simple make a table with four columns:

• First column has each aspect or feature of the project

• Second column has a score of importance from 1 to 10

• Third column has a score of difficulty from 10 (easiest) to 1 (hardest)

• Fourth column has an average of the scores for importance and difficulty. This can be a simple average or it can be weighted (if you have a lot of time for example you can put higher weight on the importance)

You prioritize the items with the highest score on the fourth column. Those are important and achievable.

**Personal experience**

I have struggled with Exceptionalism Disorder my whole life. I did not know what it was until I made up the name for it, but this did not mean it was not affecting me. In my first serious job it led to me becoming a workaholic. In sports, it got me both doing excessive efforts and struggling to find motivation when I failed to live up to my expectations. In my personal projects it’s a devil on my shoulder telling me what I create is not good enough to show the world and that I have to make it better, and better, and better.

I would never have published this article if I had not gotten this disorder under control. Even so, this article is a procrastination of a bigger project where I fear I have not made it exceptional enough. So I should end this and get back to confronting that demon head-on.

I’m brand new to CrossFit, I’m about to go into my 3rd week of it. I joined because they advertised for a 6 week challenge and I thought it would be a great opportunity to get back into shape. 
A little back story on me is that I had a MD on my L5 about 8 months ago. So needless to say I’m extremely out of shape. Also my mobility is for shit, especially since my S1 nerve is a huge part of why i needed surgery. Doing lunges for my right leg is really hard. Also how the bell do you practice doing toe to bar, that shit is nuts to me. Needles to say I’m overwhelmed. 
I can’t keep up with any of the sets. It’s honestly kind of embarrassing.

1073,"I just started CrossFit, been lifting for years so I have decent form and strength, cardio is garbage though.

I'd like to get to a point where I can RX WODs this year, not competitively but at least just meeting the WOD standards.

Any advice?",submissions,crossfit
1074,"Im an instructor at our local box and im trying to come up with an alternative fun team WOD(teams of 2, 1 working, 1 resting) where instead of reps, the attendees have to earn points. We are not an elite gym, does of 40-60 year of old, overweight etc, but lots of people having been doing crossfit for years and knows the movements.

Its a barbell focused WOD, where they(men RX) starts with 60 lbs, have to earn a certain number of points, then add 25 lb to the barbell, earn a certain number of points again, then add another 25 lbs, all the way up to 185 lbs. 

(im from Europe, so we use kilos, so the weights are conversion and not 100% correct)

Points| Weight
---|---
100 | 60
90 | 85
80 | 110
70 | 135
60 | 160
50 | 185

Each time they add weight and after they are done with the last weight and points, they need to do 20 medball get ups, 20 burpees over bar, 20 pull ups, so a total of 6 times doing this.

To earn points they can chose from the barbell movements below. A movement can only be used at one weight. So if they do power cleans with the 110 weight, they cant use it at another weight(atleast not earn any points from it).

Points | Movement
---|---
0,5| Deadlift
1 | Front Squat
1| Back Squat
1| Power Clean
1| Front lunges
1| Back Lunges
2| OH Squat
2| OH lunges
2| Power Snatch
2| Full Clean
2| Power Clean to OH
3| Thrusters
3| Full Snatch
3| Full Clean to OH
4| Clusters

So at 60 lbs they have to earn 100 points, they can chose to do 200 deadlifts, 100 power cleans, 50 OH squats, 34 Thrusters, 25 Clusters etc. Like with thrusters they would get to 99 points after 33 reps, they can then do another thrusters or a 1 point movement, but both movements cant be used again at another weight. If they chosed OH Squats and did a power snatch to get into position, the power snatch could earn them 2 points, but that would also mean that they cant use power snatch at another weight.

Using a rack is allowed. People can start and progress with any weight they feel comfortable with. Like the easiest weight could be starting at 30 lbs and progress with 10 lbs at each step, for total of 80 lbs.

Does the workout make sense? Do you think it would be fun?

Im aiming for a 30 minutes time cap, do you think most people could finish?

Do you agree with the amount of points for each movements?

Ive considered removing some movements to make it a bit more comprehensible, but im not sure which. Perhaps some of the squats or lunges?

Also bonus questions. What movements would you use at which weights?",submissions,crossfit

However, about an hour after it started (I had just finished the first WOD), my nose instantly became very irritated and I started having sneezing fits. It was pretty intense. I thought it was maybe just a bunch of chalk in the air and that it would stop after I left, but it ended up lasting the rest of the day, even after I took a shower and washed my face like 3x in the shower.

It’s now the morning after and my nose is pretty congested and I’m still sneezing.

I am relatively new to CrossFit, but like many others absolutely love it and got a bit addicted. I am stronger, fitter, feel better mentally and physically than ever. I enjoy the community, the workouts, the strength gains. I just finished a gymnastics program with a coach to get me introduced to the movement mechanics of gymnastics and am working towards pull-ups and TTB. 

My progress however is greatly limited by my strength. For background, I am a 180 cm/5'11 woman. Before CrossFit, I never did any type of strength training in my life, only cardio in the form of some running here and there, cycling and some random classes at gyms.  I can't do a push up, pull ups (yet, getting there ;)), and am very weak in DL, BP and squats (also squats are hard when you have insanely long legs). 

I think I need to focus on building strength for a bit, or quite a while, because I think it will help tremendously in the rest of CrossFit.

I used to be a long distance runner and just walked into planet fitness one day and got on a machine and went right back to the front desk and canceled.   
That 1st year I was still running for weight loss about 3-5 times a week. started with going to CF 2-3 times a week. Gave up LD running last winter and focusing more on getting thru the WODs and increasing endurance so I can get further into the workouts in the time allotted.  Slowly increased to 4-5 days. Almost 2 years later and I go in 6-8 times a week to work on various moves, strength training and still focusing on endurance. (muscle and cardio) 

This December they had a Saturday where they did the 1000 lb challenge. I didn't know it was going on, just showed up to workout. All the energy and seeing everyone cheering each other on really got me motivated.  I decided I want to give this a real try. Hopefully by this Dec.  

One of my biggest problems in the past , working on programmed extra credit, when I go heavy (for me) and low reps, it takes so long for my old body to recover. My next workouts suffer and I don't want to get injured.

-the heel is awesome and kinda locks in so there's no slipping on box jumps, running etc

Cons

-did heavy deadlifts/squats and they have a little bit of squish underneath the ball of my feet but didn't feel unstable... Some people like a really sturdy/stiff shoe for lifting so might not be for them

-they use a suede on the upper that just collects dust and dirt quickly

I’m interested in what the community thinks, if there are any that have switched off Mayhem (and why), and if there are any that can advocate for Underdogs.

i’m considering to get an apple watch to track my heart rate and kcal in crossfit.
But I think it could be unconfortable if i had to wear a wristband (i use to wear if i have to workout with heavy hang power clean), so i’m in doubt.
I thought whoop could be a great option but think is too expensive.
If you use apple watch to track your wods, can u tell your experience?

1142,"I (F33, 5'2, 110 lbs) started crossfit in September 2022. Before that, I had been lifting weights at the gym (for 7 years) and doing various types of cardio, most recently spinning, which I still do. My cardio is really good, strict strength isn't great, but my technique is good according to my coaches and I'm pretty confident with these movements thanks to my previous experience in the gym (squat 1 rep max = 112 lbs, deadlift = 138 lbs, shoulder press = 55 lbs). 

As soon as I started crossfit, I noticed my biggest weakness was explosiveness/power. My jumps are pathetic, both vertical and horizontal (still can't jump on the box, forward jumps look like a baby bunny leap 😂) and I struggle being explosive in olympic lifts, even though I definitely improved since starting. Not that surprising, since I had never done any explosive movements before. But my problem is that when any kind of olympic lift or explosive movement comes up in a WOD (cleans, push jerks, snatches, thrusters, etc.), my legs start shaking like crazy, which makes it even harder, because I'm less stable. I suspect it's either because of adrenaline, fear (cause I'm not confident with these movements) or my lack of fast-twitch muscle fibers. What do you think? Have you ever struggled with that? Any tips? Can I gain more fast-twitch muscle fibers over time or is it a genetically determined thing?",submissions,crossfit

1164,"Hi all,

We've been building out Ardor for the past year in the dark and it is now ready to be tried in the wild.

For those with a background in CrossFit, we made a dedicated page to help explain what we offer: [https://www.ardor.fitness/coming-from-cross-func-fitness](https://www.ardor.fitness/coming-from-cross-func-fitness)

Or if you want, read on below:

Ardor was born out wanting to solve and address the individual needs within the CrossFit and various fitness communities in an adaptive, instantly responsive way and do this at an affordable price. I left big tech last year to begin this journey of building out Ardor. 

Like all passion projects, it started with our own fitness needs wanting to be solved but we've been following groups like this subreddit community and seen a ton of individual posts and wants come up that we think Ardor can tackle. Here's some examples of things we have seen come up:  


&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I have dumbbells, a pull up bar, and a rower, can you maximize workouts for me with this?""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""In fact, sometimes I'm at home, at my open gym, and on the road, can you keep multiple equipment lists?""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""I want to spend a bit more time right now on some gymnastics/calisthenics work, can you prioritize that?""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""I am short time and not rested but I don't want to fall off the bandwagon, can you dial down the intensity and duration for my WOD today but keep the same structure?""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""I like to throw in the odd bodybuilding session, can you add that in while being mindful of my other programming and what's strained?""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""I'm a shift worker, can you build me progressional multi-week programming but only on these specific dates this month?""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""I don't want to do any more Olympic Weightlifting, can you remove that?""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""I don't have space to run with my setup, are there programs that remove mono structural exercises altogether?""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""If I start getting stronger with my strength training, can you automatically reflect that in the weights used in my metcons?""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""Can you tell me when I will finish this workout so I have a goal? And can you update all my workouts then after so my personal goals and targets change daily?""

The above is just a small sample of what it can handle. We've built a robust AI backend that doesn't pre-program anything. It makes predictions about your ability for every single exercise. How much you can lift, how many reps you can do, how fast you can do the movement, and what's your pace reduction over time. As you do workouts, it evolves daily and makes changes for your next planned workouts, on a per exercise level. **In what we believe is a first in the space, it can handle any AMRAP, RFT, interval based workout and make a prediction for how long it will personally take you to finish**. Ardor factors rests, how different exercises paired together affect your stamina, your aerobic vs anaerobic abilities, and when some skilled/bodyweight exercises need to be scaled.

As we trained Ardor, we slowly discovered why this hasn't been done to the same extent before. Finding the relations between exercises, allowing invidual variance in ability, and improving accuracy over time was some of the hardest parts of getting a personal trainer's brain into an app.

 I get it, sounds like a gimmick and not real but **we are confident at this stage that if you give 5 workouts a go, all the weights and times should start falling within 5% of accuracy for 90% of people.**

What we think is exciting and different about this model is you are getting workouts that are designed for you, and only you. You can compete against yourself from yesterday and, over time, see how you are getting better.

Ardor can do a whole lot more. We spent a ton of time on keeping the UI clean and minimal, with built in various timers and trackers that are consistent across all strength and conditioning workouts so you you can stay within the app.

Cost wise, our mission is to always provide individualized and personalized fitness training at an affordable price. Right now, we want to build out our user base and make it even more robust so we are offering an early price that goes even further than that. **Subscribe now for as little as $5.99 / month.**

You can try it out today and see how personal it can get for you, for free. **As part of the current promotion, get full access to the app for 14 days or until you finish 5 workouts**. After 5 workouts you should start to see the accuracy improve.

I have a weird scenario going on with my lower left back/upper glute area.

For instance..deadlift 300lbs no problem. Drop the bar and AHHHH F+#*}* that hurts. 

Tonight’s WOD included an EMOM with 3 back squats and 3 front squats for 10 rounds. I got to round 5 and couldn’t take it anymore. 
Load the weight (135lbs)
Back Squat 
Press over

I was lucky enough to spend two weeks with my in-laws in a house full of sugar and where we ate out several meals during that time.

Pros
-VIP tickets are awesome...we sprung for the VIP tickets that have reserved seating right in front of the action (thankfully we have family in the area so instead of spending money on accommodation we spent it on tickets)
- tons of opportunity to run into and chat with athletes. Travis Mayer and Jason Khalipa were highlights as they were both awesome and fun to chat with
-the programming made the events fun to watch. We have liftoff was super fun to watch with the mix of heavy barbell and then gymnastics right behind it. Double shot with a splash was unreal with Ricky and Roman coming down to the wire
-the community was awesome, chatted with tons of people and had great conversations between events and waiting in line etc 


Cons
-the venue is almost too small, tons of people trying to get into limited seating. If you don't have VIP tickets you have to post up at a venue and commit to being there hours before the elites events

1251,"I had total right hip replacement 7 weeks ago. Wondering if there are any others that have continued with their crossfit journey with joint replacement?

Background: started crossfit a year ago and loved it. Best thing to ever happen to my health, mentality and marriage.  6 months in I ended up with a stress fracture in femur from running. That's when I found out I already had the necrosis in the hip. Had surgery to pin the femur to fix fracture. Made my return and was doing good for few weeks (after initial surgery recovery) , but then the necrosis set in and the bone collapsed. 

I finally convinced my wife to let me go back this week. I have clearance from doc to do bike and anything from therapy. So basically I ride the bike erg for 35 minutes while they do stretching and strength. Them, when they do WOD I modify it for my abilities. Just wondering what I should legitimately set my expectations for the next couple years if I will ever be able to even do a ""prescribed scale"" again? I.e. burpees, Squats, sit ups. I'm pretty much coming to the reality that probably not, but the community and people at my gym are too good to leave. Thanks for listening, look forward to any info anyone has.",submissions,crossfit

1256,"I have been feeling really gassed in my WODs so I decided to buy a Polar HR monitor and have been tracking for about a month. It seems that my HR spikes and sustains pretty high during the workouts causing fatigue in longer WODs which is affecting my performance. I have tried to explain this to my coach who is fantastic but she has just told me in the past to push through. Today I showed her the polar HR data from the WOD and she couldn't believe that my HR spikes and was sustained so high for the workout. I told her that was normal and maybe even a little bit lower as I have been pacing myself more now that I am aware of how high it is. She  asked if I was taking preworkout which I am and advised me to stop taking it explaining that it was causing my HR to spike and decreasing my performance. 

I feel when I started taking preworkout that it enhanced my workouts but that's when I first started and wasn't in the same shape that I am in now. 

I do RX L2 workouts and can do L3 workouts but not in the time caps provided. I am getting ready to start doing scaled competitions so I am trying to run diagnostics on areas that I need to make changes in and increasing cardio and pacing are definitely areas I am seeking to improve.",submissions,crossfit

1293,"Hi all, 

Just wanting to gather some feedback if I am the only one suffering from this. Please delete if not allowed. 

A little bit of background, i am 26M about 200lbs and have been doing crossfit/going to the gym for about 6 years. Would consider myself fit when I compare myself to my group of md twenties friends. Eating +-3500 cal a day and 150 grams of protein. and doing my daily GOWOD and postwod stretching. 

Have been upping my training over the last 2 weeks and attacking the workouts more than I have done before, 6 days a week 2 hours heavy workout. Where 1 hour is a wod with a strength component. And the other a monostructural cardio with a skill component. Working out normally between 6pm-8:30pm. 

The last few days I have been waking up at night with tingly sensation down my spine/legs. And after waking up not being to get back to sleep again. Waking up very restless. 

Now I have been googling a little bit, and what I have been coming up with was CNS fatique/overtraining. But I am still able to attack the workout the next day with not to much muscle aches.

The area of pain isn't that broad now but i do some rope jumps and like WOW WTH IT HURTS SO BACK.

1308,"I've travelled quite a bit in the last few months and had the chance to train in perhaps 7? different boxes. I mostly do open gym (HWPO) but sometimes will join a class.

Now, I understand that most people are no necessarily for performances and/or crazy improvements. However, I just feel like normal 60 minutes classes are not efficient timewise. 

A 90 minute class is only 50% more time but expected ""yield""  is close to 100% more results.

&amp;#x200B;

Normal classes

0-3 (if it starts on time) = Coach explain the warmup, strength/skill and WOD.

3-5 = people get ready for warmup

6-12 = warmup

13-14 = transition from warm-up to skill

15-17 = coach explain technique

18-20 = people grab weights/prepare station

21-35 = 3 to 6 series of reps.   
Example 4x5 back squat @ 75% (2/3 series buildup)

36-37 = transitions

38-40 = coach explain wod and wod preparation

41-57 = WOD

58-60 = fist bumps &amp; picking up weight

In the end, within those 60 minutes you had perhaps 5 minutes of exercise (Warm-up) \~3 minutes of muscle under heavy tension (strength) and another 15 minutes of exercise (Wod).

**Out of the 60 minutes you are working/resting \~35 minutes/60 = \~58%**

Also, how are you suppose to progress strength wise doing squat once a week for 4 series? C&amp;J once a week \~4-5 series...

\-------------------------------------------------

90 minutes class 

0-3 (if it starts on time) = Coach explain the warmup, strength/skill and WOD.

3-5 = people get ready for warmup

6-12 = warmup

13-14 = transition from warm-up to skill

15-17 = coach explain technique

18-20 = people grab weights/prepare station

21-55 = 2 movements 3 to 6 series of reps.   
Example:   


* 2x8 back squat @ 60%  
2x6 back squat @ 70%  
2x4 back squat @ 75%  
2x4 Power Clean @ 70%  
2x3 Power Clean @ 75%  
1x2 Power Clean @ 80%

 

56-57 = transitions

58-60 = coach explain wod and wod preparation

61-89 = WOD (or 2 short ones.. \~28 minutes)

89-90 = fist bumps &amp; picking up weight

&amp;#x200B;

Within those 90 minutes you had perhaps 5 minutes of exercise (Warm-up) + 6-7 minutes of muscle under heavy tension (strength) + another \~28 minutes of exercise (Wod) + 10 minute deep stretch.

Basically by increasing the classes by 50% you gain 100% strength/skill time, \~80% more wod times. Also by having twice the amount of time in ""skill/strength"" this would give time to actually practice some useful skills. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Out of the 90 minutes you are working/resting \~70 minutes/90 = \~78%**  


**However, you are doubling your working/resting time from 35 to 70 minutes just by increasing 30 minutes the class.**

&amp;#x200B;

*What do you guys think about 90 minutes classes instead of classic 60 minutes ones?*

Graag zou ik willen weten of onze work-out eigenlijk wel onder 'crossfit' valt. En zo niet, waar valt het dan wel onder?

Met 2 collega's doen we wekelijks de volgende routine:
20 inverted rows
20 tricep dips
100 push-ups in sets van 20.
Dit is onze warming-up terwijl we naar de training site wandelen (30 min.).

100 reverse grip push-ups
100 leg raises
100 supermans
50 bicycle crunches
100 squads
100 standing hamstring stretches

Hierna joggen we zo'n 6km terug (45 tot 60 min) en eindigen we met
20 inverted rows
20 tricep dips

1410,"Good day all! I hope everyone is having a great new year. I'm posting this to a few different sub-reddits so apologies if you read it twice. I need advice or potential ideas for how to move forward in my fitness journey. 
My main goal is to loss weight ( I am 6'7"" and currently 257.4lbs goal weight is 225lbs) and become more aesthetically pleasing to myself and others. 
I have been doing Crossfit for about 2 years and have been plagued with a calf injury that prevents me from jumping excessively. So that causes difficulty in workouts. However, I struggle with the large commercial gyms as I'm not a big crowd person, plus motivation. 
The other issue is distance. So I live in a small town, the only gyms here in my town are a CrossFit gym (that I don't go to), a Planet Fitness(PF), Anytime(AT), and a powerlifing gym called Raw Iron(RI) that are independently owned between locations and memberships do not transfer between locations.
I work 45-50 mins away in a larger town that has plenty of options for gyms such as Crunch Fitness(CF) and another (RI). Now I use a CrossFit gym in the town I work in. When I started my job (2 years ago) I was required to be in the office 5 days a week for training thus I joined the CrossFit I was driving anyway so I just get up at 4ampack my lunch and clothes and drive the 45 mins to the gym and get there by the 530am class. Then work 730-5 and home. Now that I have been employed for a period of time I can now work from home up to 10 days a month. Thus I do not have to travel the 45 mins saving gas and money and time. This causes an issue as it is cutting my gym time down to approx 3 a week.
If I joined the crossfit gym in the town where I live. I am not able to get to work on time at 730 because the 45 min trip is only applicable when the trip is made before 5am. After that traffic and school busses cause delays. I don't like PF as I do Lift heavy weights and sometimes to failure thus dropping occasionally = lunk alarm😵.
Membership fees aren't an issue really. My CrossFit gym is $150 a month and for 20+ classes a month that seemed ok but when you cut down the number of class to 3 a week that doesn't make sense plus when I want to workout on a Saturday/Sunday or a day I'm working from home. I don't want to drive 45 mins to workout. Also no weights at home and not enough disposable income to really get a decent setup.
So after reading all this and advice could be appreciated I plan to be as responsive as I can and answer questions.

I’m surprised to see how competitive I am in CrossFit seeing is how I go once a week or every other week. ( I strength train 3 days a week, bjj 3-4 days a week and kickboxing 1 day a week. run 3-4 days a week, and I’m doing the knees over toes program which has been so impactful).  

So back to my friend. And here is where my question begins. Since my buddy has been extremely into crossfit or the cult 😆✌️ haha all love; he refuses to run. Like he absolutely will not run. He thinks if he runs he’s gonna kill all his strength gains. What do you guys think of this? Is running one day a week with me for 5-8 miles gonna ruin him? I honestly don’t think so. Especially after the run if he consumes more calories then he burnt in the run.  

It’s funny bc this guy a couple years ago was drunk at a bar telling me about this 50k. Thought he was just drunk. We ended up doing 2 50ks that year and it was a great exp. Now he’s scared to run and I just don’t see it. And I think he’s competing my high rocks but after that has no plan on competing. I’m trying to convince him to do ultra w me after he’s done his competition. But I feel like he’s got this mind set that running is bad for him.  

How should I go about this?

This was the toughest thing I’ve ever had to do. Been an average gym lifter going on 2/3 years. Daily or every other day or normal bro split style workouts with hardly any cardio ever thrown in. 

Ended up eating terrible last night because today we’re starting 75 hard and wanted to enjoy my last meal. 

Today we did the 5am morning class on an empty stomach and it consisted of 40 min of erg with a team of 3 rotating between skis and bike each minute. Did a total of 1174 cal in the 40 min and I was dead. 

Made it through, but similar to how I feel after a huge leg day felt the urge to vomit and I did. After about 2 hours starting to feel much better after eating half a banana and just laying down. 

I am curious is any other people had the same type of experience after your first class? Is it normal to get this sick? My wife who did the class with me who has not workout out for near as long not as hard did great and never got sick so just had me a bit concerned.

1486,"I've been a member of a chain of crossfit gyms in Copenhagen, Denmark for about 3 years. I joined because I was bored with going to the gym alone and I liked the idea of being able to just show up to a class and getting a workout that was always different and varied.

Something happened to their programming after covid though. The workouts got shorter and less varied. Basically seemed like they got lazy and have since then put minimal effort into putting together workouts. 

Here are some examples of WODs from this week:

*A. Deadlift 5x3 reps* 

*B. 5 RFT (TC: 13 min)*

* *10 DL*
* *20 Push-ups*

and

A. Push press 4x4 reps

B. EMOM 20

* 4 Burpees
* 5 Wall balls

This is the standard. Usually some kind of lift followed by a short high-intensity workout. I don't feel like I'm getting a good enough workout - it feels too short and simple.

After training more consistently on the C2 rower, really enjoy using the ErgData app to both (a) set up the workout and (b) data analysis/tracking post workout (as well as having it linked to Garmin Connect)

I’m of Ethiopian background, a lawyer, in my 30s, female and do crossfit. I recently befriended my gym owner and his wife (both white). The gym is majority white, and we have 2 black male members and 3 black women. I am friendly with everyone, including the black members. I am not attracted to either of the black guys, and I don’t think we have much in common aside from being black crossfitters. I don’t think the guys even like me in that way, I know one gawks at my body, so maybe he does.

There is a white guy I do get along with and have flirty vibes with.  And there is a plethora of other men that I get along with too. 

The gym owner has been encouraging me to date bc I am often alone (I know it comes from a good place). But he has recently asked me if I am interested in either of the 2 black men in the gym, and no one else. Like these guys are nice but it’s like he thinks the only criteria for me is: Black. Before this, his wife asked if I was interested in one of the black guys. She said she was thinking about the single men that would be a good match. But there are plenty of other single men. I mean I know single lawyers at the gym, and they didn’t suggest those guys (non-Black). Or other guys that are ‘matches’ based on shared interests. So I can’t help but think that they believe I should pair with someone based on my skin color alone.  It’s not even similar culture bc both guys are American, and not of my ethnicity.

1585,"500-5, the 500lb squat and sub 5 minute mile in the same day.

I believe this is achievable for me next December. In that last few years I have squatted 600lbs(early 2020) and run a 5:33 mile (late 2021), more recently I’ve leaned hard in to the running. In April/May of 2022 I’ve run a 19:06 3 mile and squatted 385 x 4 in the same week. In the near future I plan on testing my squat 1rm and then running the mile to figure out my baseline to see if this really is feasible.

1586,"Hello,  
I (26/M/170) recently was released after spending 6 days in the hospital for rhabdo. I know there's already quite a few stories on this sub, but I wanted to add my story to the body of anecdotes that already exists.   
Background: I was a 4-5 days a week crossfitter for the last 3 years. In early November I went on vacation for a week, and also got injured/sick for another 2 weeks. I was still active (2-3 days a week) but just a tad out of shape and trying to get back in the swing of things.   
Cue Angie, a workout that I thought would be perfect to get back on the workout wagon because it's all bodyweight. To start, I did 20-20-20-15-10-5-5-5 for pullups via butterflies, and went nearly unbroken with the pushups, situps, and squats. I finished in 12:16, with a massive pump in my biceps and lats that felt like just an intense upper body workout.  
For the next few days, that pump/swelling never went away, and the soreness involved got worse over time. My arms were stuck at 90°, and I also couldn't raise them above my shoulders due to lat stiffness. Three days after the workout my arms were getting worse, and after slamming water for 72 hours my urine turned a tinge brown, which prompted a trip to the ER.   
My CK levels were at 89,000 for the first blood test, and slowly went down for a few days before some steep drops. While admitted at the hospital, they pumped me with nearly 30 bags of fluids over 6 days. It's taken 10 days (and a lot of bathroom breaks) to get back to normal levels, and at this point the physician said I'm basically back to normal. Haven't worked out since, but plan on slowly getting back in once the new year starts.   
Just a little bit of information for the masses. I think the biggest lessons learned were: 1) for experienced people that usually go Rx and are in great shape, be cognizant of trying to meet your baseline times/scores after an extended break, and 2) eccentric movements are key. In all my reading while in the hospital, nearly all incidents came from GHD and specifically pullups (all scaled versions as well). I strongly believe what pushed me over the edge were the butterfly pullups, of which I hadn't done in 4-5 weeks. My joints and muscles were not ready for that taxation. I strongly think that the body is great at letting you know what its limits are, but the nature of eccentric movements like butterfly pullups doesn't necessarily allow your lats and biceps to tell you that you've gone too far. I don't think anyone really has to worry about rhabdo for things like cardio or Olympic lifts, but that's my amateur conclusion.  
Anyway, that's is. Let me know if you have any questions, or any advice about working out post-rhabdo.",submissions,crossfit

I do however have one concern: I’ve had injured my left shoulder (rotator cuff) three times, with the most recent one keeping out of the gym for about 3 months. It took another 2-3 months to get my bench press back to where it was. Benching with a bar bell STILL aggravates my shoulder so usually stick with dumbbells. Looking at some of the core CrossFit movements, I wonder if they wouldn’t flair up my shoulder injury again.

I’m curious to hear some thoughts on this! For some extra context, I’m a guy in my mid thirties, and I go to the gym 3-4 times a week and run twice a week. I’d consider myself very fit, for what it’s worth.

# Benefits of Weightloss

*Processing img o872vkxtu68a1...*

Major Weight Loss

If you are overweight, over 40 years of age, or haven't exercised regularly for a long time, check with your doctor before you start any physical activity. There are many unhealthy misconceptions about weight loss but to reduce your weight, and keep it off, you need to make small, achievable changes to your lifestyle.

[Weight loss](https://www.lustydiets.com/trimax-keto-gummies-reviews/) happens when a person exerts more energy than they consume. The body seeks out stores of energy, starting with fat, to make up for the shortfall.

Making peace with the scale means different things to different people. Some people find the scale emotionally triggering, in which case, it’s not a useful tool. But research shows that other people benefit from daily or weekly weigh-ins and it doesn’t always lead to issues. In fact, studies suggest self-monitoring, which may include weigh-ins and tracking food, are predictors not only of weight loss but maintenance, too.

The wants for work items:

* Laptop sleeve
* Medium pocket to store chargers, pens, and small PPE/first aid kit

The wants for gym items:

* Majority of the backpack volume dedicated to clothes storage
   * Preferably enough room for 2-3 days of gym clothes so I don't have to worry about packing each night and enough room for my work clothes from the day
* Dedicated shoe compartment
   * This is a deal breaker for me. I'm not as concerned about the smell as I am about having a dedicated area for when my shoes are wet from the rain or snow.
* Small pocket for tape, chalk, and minor accessories
* Medium pocket for extra headbands and toiletries 
   * My current schedule allows me to go in the afternoon, but it would be a plus to be able to have room for travel body wash/shampoo if I start going in the mornings before work and to shower before leaving

1683,"Good morning/afternoon everyone,

I am currently looking for new in ear headphones for training. I'm doing multiple sports, like CrossFit, Jogging and rope jumping (obviously would only use them for the parts i do completly on my own).
Especially for Rope Jumping I would need Ear Buds that fit really well and dont drop out.

I have looked around but i am uncertain as to what kind of earbuds i could use, i found topics from years ago, but nothing recent. Currently I'm eyeing the ""Jabra Elite 7 Active"" but i am not sure as to how good they are for their purpose.

My budget ist around 100€, it would be nice to have some sort of ANC (noise cancelling) as I would also like to use them in the office from time to time and they should not fall out / feel comfortable during workouts.

Any of you got any idea or recommendation as to what Ear Buds i could go with?

1697," The stock market is one of the places where you can have activities and make a great deal of money and even investments.

In this trading market, shares of every stock get traded among the sellers and buyers; some profit and some lose money.

Keep in mind that there are many ways that you can do this.

However, some of the strategies we discussed need complex calculations,

But the way we will tell you about them in this article will help you significantly because it is efficient.

You will need simple measures, and you can do it yourself.

We will talk about the formula and examples of the Average Volume in Stock,

And then we will tell you how this strategy can benefit your investment and business.

Let’s begin by learning more about ADTV or Average Daily Trade Volume.

We shall begin.

## The Average Volume in stock: FULL DEFINITION

In the financial market, there are many strategies you have to know about to choose the right one for the conditions you are in.

In this article section, we will talk about aborting the Average Volume in stock.

Let’s see an example.

Imagine that Apple stocks are getting traded in the market, and since you are one of the buyers of these stock shares,

You have to know how long you have to keep them and when you should sell them.

To do so, you have to know that there is something called the Average  Volume in stock, which declares the average amount of the shares that  get traded; this can be beneficial.

Because the results of this method attract different buyers, you have to know your way around these methods.

Before getting to the next section, let’s see what the formulas and examples of the Average Volume in stock are:

* **Average Volume in stock (X-Period) = sum of the shares traded / days of trade**

In which:

* **Some of the shares traded = gathering of all the claims that get sold in an X number of days**
* **Days of trade = number of days that a certain percentage is traded**

Now let’s see what the example for this matter is.

Imagine that you are trying to calculate the Average Volume in stock in **30** days, and the total volume of the shares is **12850**.

Therefore we have:

* **X = 12850 / 30**
* **X = 428.333**

From the example, you can understand that there are many factors but who is to say what the good Average Volume in stock is?

In the next section of the article, we will discuss the aspects of  the Average Volume in stock and what is an excellent Average Volume in  stock.

## What would be an excellent Average Volume for stock trading?

As we have discussed the method you have to use to find the Average  Volume in stock, in this section, we intend to tell you about the  benefits and the right amount of Average Volume in stock.

Let’s begin.

First of all, we have to tell you that if you are an investor or  someone that just entered the stock world, make sure to go into trading  the stocks with a Volume of 20 – 25 million dollars.

Because when the Volume increases, the institutions tend to perform better, and you can get more profit than other stocks.

The next matter that we have to talk about is that when you use the  Average Volume in stock method to calculate what shares you should buy  or sell, you are predicting the future; however, it is not possible to  predict the end it will give you a complete view of the market.

And using this information, you can easily trade in the stock market and lose the minimum amount of money and shares.

Now that you have all the information needed let’s get to the end of the statement.

### Overall…

Making money by investing and trading has been a big part of the  financial market, and if you know the methods and strategies to analyze  this market, you will get the profit you want.

In these articles, we mentioned some methods you can use, and we have set examples and formulas to understand the subject

 better.

This article talked about Average Volume in stock, its benefits, and formulas.

Then we reached the section that declared what a good Average Volume in stock is, and we answered your question.

Remember that you must read every article section with full attention to have the best possible result.

In the end, we are honored that you chose the “What is a good average  volume in stocks?” article to find us more about the Average Volume in  stock.

In addition, we would love to hear all of your thoughts through the comment section or the contact page.

Good luck in your trades in the stock market.",submissions,crossfit

1.  Why are people believing they can do high rep olympic lifts when even the top olympic lifting gold medalists regard it as nonsensical?
2. Why are people OK joining a box to be trained by someone whose certification took 48 hours?
3. Regarding both first questions, aren't the injuries from these things reflecting poorly on your hobby?  Shouldn't these be top priority to fix?
4. What is gained from kipping pullups?
5. Correct me if I am wrong, but many people seem to get into this because they want to both feel and look good.  However, given the use of some highly complex movements especially for rep ranges they shouldn't be used for, why not just combine regular weight training with sprinting?

In 2019 I found out I had Athletic Pubalgia, which is like a really awful groin injury. I was with Kaiser at the time. They recommended against surgery and dragged things out for almost a year trying lots of things that didn't work. I eventually just gave up and went out of network to have the surgery done with a specialist I trusted. This was after almost a year of experiencing day-to-day pain, being unable to do CrossFit or even run for that matter. It was awful.

Then in 2021 I herniated a disc in my lower back doing a workout with heavy deadlifts. The resulting sciatica was really painful and it took about 3 months to recover from. I spent another 6 months working out in my garage, gradually ramping back up before I was comfortable going back into the gym. 

Finally, about 3 weeks ago, while I was on vacation with my wife, I somehow managed to injure my lower back again during a Yin Yoga class (the chillest of yogas... WTF). I'm mostly physically recovered from this last injury as it wasn't nearly as bad as my disc injury in 2021 however, I find myself feeling really frustrated and demotivated. 

Each time I've been injured I've tried to understand how I can adapt my training/lifestyle to prevent it in the future. I stretch often, I work with a chiropractor, I've improved my form and I've gotten more conservative towards goals and my approach to training. I'm also 42 and getting older. 

I can't help but wonder if I'm doing something wrong or just not good at this. I have a lot of fear that one day I'm going to end up injuring myself in a way I can't recover from and then it will all be over. The thought of not having CrossFit in my life or being physically active is just depressing.

Anyway, I could use some feedback or encouragement. Is this normal stuff or am I fucking up? Anyone else had similar experiences? Thanks in advance.",submissions,crossfit

Does anyone here have experience with this injury?

TLDR: diagnosed with glute tendonapothy. Dry needling provides relief for like 2 weeks, then will have a random flare up. Each flare up less intense.


Back story: I’ve been battling with Gluteal Tendonopathy since July. Initially started feeling tightness in my glute belly after longer runs. Eventually stopped running, kept weight lifting with fairly high lower body frequency. Pain got worse. In addition to pain in my glute belly and glute/SI crest, it also spread to my GT region. Thought maybe I was having issues with my TFL. Pain got so severe I could barely walk before I decided to see a PT. Was diagnosed with glute tendonopathy. Although I haven’t had an MRI, No pain reproduction with straight leg or slump test,  which was enough evidence for my PT to rule out a disc issue. Since working with the PT, my pain has decreased, but still getting random flare ups. Dry needling seems to be the most effective band aid, I go from mild flare up pain to completely pain free, unrestricted lower body weight lifting movements. However, I am still getting random flare ups. I am doing my PT (clam shells, glute bridges, etc) in conjunction with leg press and hip hinge movements in the gym. The PT has cleared me for these movements as they don’t reproduce pain, but just when I am confident I am 100% pain free, I’ll have another flare up. I have been working with the PT for about 6 weeks.


Currently active duty mil. MRI is not an option as I’ll lose m designation if the unlikely event of a disc issue that is producing these symptoms is present.

I really enjoy this as its fairly easy to do if I am traveling for work (which I do often); find a park or hotel gym with a place to do pullups and you get a great full body session in.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the very basic leg movements I actually enjoy and get a bit more benefit from is a walking lunch; I like the unilateral nature of it and I seem to stay a bit more mobile if I am doing a lot of lunges as opposed to squats for whatever reason.

200 pushups

400 lunges (200 per leg)

1738,"With the open around the corner, I thought it would be a good idea to start thinking about the people that want to do the open at home - whether do to COVID, convenience or lack of local boxes.

We won’t know exactly what equipment you need for the 2023 CrossFit Open until CrossFit HQ release their list near the end of January 2023. But we can use historical workouts to get an idea of what you will need.

I went through every Open workout from 2017-2022 to determine what equipment typically shows up in the Open. 

The equipment you will (likely) need to do the CrossFit Open at home:

* A pair of 35 lbs (women)/50 lbs (men) dumbbells
* A barbell (35lbs for women, 45 lbs for men)
* Bumper plates up to 205 lbs for women, 315 lbs for men (or potentially up to your 1RM for something like a deadlift)
* A wall ball (14 lbs for women, 20 lbs for men)
* Pull up bar with room to perform muscle ups
* Skipping rope
* Gymnastic rings with room to perform muscle ups
* A plyometric box (20 inch tall for women, 24 inch tall for men)
* A programmable timer
* Video camera or phone - for submitting video to be audited 
* Concept 2 Rower\*\*

\*\*The Concept 2 Rower come up in about 1 Open workout per year from 2017-2020 but haven’t seen it since. I would attribute its removal to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most people would have performed the 2021 and 2022 CrossFit Open from their home. CrossFit HQ probably realized that most people don’t have access to a rower, so they kept it out of their programming. It will be interesting to see if the Concept 2 Rower will make a return in 2023, as more people return to their box’s on a regular basis. I’d also keep an eye out for Echo Bikes/Assault Bikes making an appearance in 2023.

Hope this helps as people finish up their Christmas wish lists and start looking for Boxing Day deals.

1809,"Not sure if this is an appropriate post for this sub but I thought you all might have some insight into this**(Also I’ve read the FAQ and I still have questions)**. I have been doing crossfit for a little over 4 years now and for a number of reasons(cost, changes at my gym,...) I am thinking about leaving and doing something different. The issue that I am having now is finding a program that fits my needs, was hoping I could get some suggestions for some lifting programs that would fit the following criteria:

1.  **The program includes everything(Cardio, abs, etc)**. This is the main issue that I am having, I don’t like working out, and the reason that I’ve done crossfit for so long is because I don’t have to think about what I’m doing in a workout, all I have to do is follow the set program. When I look at the strength programs in the FAQ or other places they will say things like “accessory lift one” or “do cardio” without just saying what to do. I know I can read books and study to figure out how to build my own program, but that takes time and I really don’t enjoy any of this. So I am looking for a program that just hands me everything, so I can just do the workouts without me having to think about it much.
2. **Something I can do in a standard gym.** If I had the space I would just build my own home gym and then would follow a crossfit program like Pushjerk. However I can’t do that, so I will have to workout in a regular gym and a I need a program that I can do there.
3. **Is longer then 6 months.** Ties in with my first criteria, but most programs seem to only last for like 3-4 months and then you have to figure out what to do next. I know its just a cycle of de-loading and then re-ramping up again but no programs really spells that out in a basic day to day situation. So I am looking for a program that once again has everything for a long period of time already spelled out so I don’t have to think about it.
4. **Is at the intermediate to the advance level.**  Like I said I have been doing crossfit for 4ish years now so I am in good shape and need a program that will really push me.",submissions,crossfit

I kind of suck at them now. I don't know what happened, but in the last 6 months or so, they have become a real challenge. If they're at the beginning of a workout, I can do a good set but if I have to come back to them after doing anything else, I start tripping left and right. 

I think it's mostly a mental thing, but I also can't deny that there's a physical effect as well. I just feel way more taxed from them. Is this just a sign that I'm getting old? (I'm in my mid 30s) Has anyone else seen a strength of theirs turn into a borderline weakness?",submissions,crossfit

1912,"Hey Everyone,

So I'm looking for the most versatile dumbbell setup for my home gym. I already have a good selection of bars, bumper plates, bench and Rogue squat stands that I can move around but I want the variety that DBs provide. I'm no animal but I lift decent numbers. So I'd want to be able to press 100s and DB snatch 70s but also have the smaller weights for accessory and bodybuilding stuff. I don't mind spending money on quality stuff but also want to be economically responsible. Plus I have limited space so a full rack of DBs is out of the question.

Here's what I'm considering (post pics at the bottom for context),

1. Bowflex 1090 - \~$800 - 10-90lbs and probably the best space saving option. A little pricey but reasonable if they hold up. Some plastic components though so I worry about olympic style movements overhead especially as I put more mileage on them. Can't drop them at all really.
2. Olympic weight DB handles - \~$1000 - I'm really interested in these but there isn't a ton of info/reviews online. All my bumper plates are full size so I'd have to get an assortments of smaller 5s and 10s to use them. Even then, I'm not sure how much I can load on them. Also, collars aren't designed for bars to be vertical so I'm curious about heavy olympic movements where they will be at all angles during a lift. Cost varies depending on brand of bars and plates but I'm guessing they'll come out similar to Bowflex at the end. Can probably drop a bit if I get rub plates but would need to be careful of the angle.
3. Buy a selection of Rubber Hex dumbbells for Wods and a cheap ol' janky adjustables for everything else - \~$1000 - Hex dumbbells aren't cheap but I'd probably just buy 35s, 50s, and 70s to start. Then an old fashioned fashioned set of screw on adjustable dumbbells costs half that of Bowflex for a set that goes to 100lbs and I can use them for isolated movements. Hex DBs would be the safest for WODs but I wouldn't want to touch the adustables for olympic stuff.
4. Ironmaster - $1000+ - Similar space saving as Bowflex. Can cost more than Bowflex but also modular (KB attachment, weight expansion packs etc.). I read some reviews saying that these are scary at heavier weights and can just give out despite all components being metal. But I've also read that these are THE BEST for Crossfit so... I'm torn. Minor drops on padding might be okay.

So everything hovers around that $1000 mark give or take a few hundred but I'm really looking for some stuff that'll last me in the years to come so I'm willing to spend a little. When I mention dropping, I'm not thinking from overhead but we all get tired... What's everybody take on this? I don't want a component to give out and knock me in the head but I also can't do 5-100lbs rack of hex dumbbells as I don't have the space nor do I want to burn $3000+ right now.

Need to vent. Today's strength was Hang Squat Snatches - On the 2:30 x 6 Sets.

I never was good at snatches or OHS and up until a few months ago, I used to skip days with either, to avoid failing in front of everyone, since I am the weakest and always finish last or scale and modify everything in my 'class'.

I've had more bad days than good in the past few weeks, but I'm slowly learning that it's perfectly okay to fail in public, only because I'm super self aware and socially awkward most of the time. Doesn't help when I have an unintentionally serious face on, implying that I know wtf I'm doing when in reality I would give a limb for any kind of advice LOL.

Failed 3 reps, couldn't get the bar overhead at times or failed while in a squat position.

I hadn't done any kind of weightlifting/sports up until I joined Crossfit, was super scrawny etc so did it to get healthier but also help with my depression, bulimia and try to work on my social anxiety.

I feel like a total failure.

Anyways, I'm almost 9 months in and can barely do a #75 HSS.

My 1RMs:
#215 deadlifts
#125 front squats
#165 back squats
#125 push press

It always comes back to ""no they are tested"" or ""they are just really conditioned because this is their job"". First off, cf is a massive multi million dollar corporation that literally profits off everyday people believing they too can perform like top athletes. It is in cf best interest that their athletes cheat and perform like super humans because it means more average Joe's take up the sport. CF know most athletes at the games are doping, but they won't do anything about it. And for anyone that knows anything about testing it's a fukin joke, there are plenty of ways to get around it but that's for another time.

# You are not a cheerleader. You are a coach. 

While there is a time and place for bringing the hype during a grueling metcon, don't forget your primary obligation: Improving the lives of of your members.

Sure, workouts can be challenging but they become more challenging when your members aren't moving well. 

If you walk around class and you see a fault, don't walk by and reinforce bad movement by saying ""good job"". 

1. Stop
2. Address the athlete
3. Give a cue
4. Ensure the athlete is making progress towards your instruction
5. THEN provide positive reinforcement IF they actually fix the thing you've asked them to

Ignoring your members' bad technique during a metcon because they happen to be moving lighter weights is a recipe for disaster. Not only are they accruing repetitions with bad movement patterns (which will be harder to correct as those patterns become habit) but your members lose trust in you as a coach and the gym you're associated with. 

Don't be that coach. Be better.",submissions,crossfit

I started lifting weights because I’m 31 and was at a job desk since my twenties. Wanted to be in good shape and to find a functional body again.

However, the more I’m lifting the more I feel stiff (been doing yoga and mobility routine for 2 months now) but still, my actual body functionality is not what I was really after. I really want to find a functional body again. Be able to lift somebody hurt and to carry him for 200m (I’m a former soldier so I still live in that fantasy). Being strongman or Arnold is nice but if your body is dogshit in terms of usefulness then I feel like it’s not for me.

What should I do then? Should I try bodyweight workouts? Should I start calisthenics with some app like freeletics? I still like my actual muscle mass so If I keep my nutrition like that (high protein) will I lose muscle?

1989,"I have seen a couple of posts regarding price increases at Affiliates. I thought I would provide some context from the perspective of an Affiliate owner by breaking down my recurring expenses. This is in Canadian. For a Canadian Affiliate. 

**My total recurring expenses broken down monthly: $24,183.02**

* My biggest expense is Payroll. Payroll is somewhat tied to overall revenue. $16,180.08 includes payouts for PT. 
* My next biggest expense is my Lease: I made all of my lease payments over the pandemic and re-negotiated when we re-opened, allowing me to lock in below market until 2024.

**Credit Card Processing: 3.5 to 4%**

* This could be reduced if I switched away from Stripe. However, I pay the extra \~1% for the convenience of stripe. 
* We do our best to steer bigger payments (Team Training mostly) to invoiced e-transfer. 

**HST (Tax): 13%**

* Like all Canadian businesses, this is passed onto the consumer. However, it definately adds to the 'sticker shock' each month.

**Required Monthly Gross Income: $28,294.11**

* The Total amount of money to come in each month required to keep the lights on. 

While expenditures likely vary substantially, this is a decent overview. **I have not included a ton of incidentals:** new equipment, repairs + maintenance,  toilet paper, sharpie makers, sanitary wipes, and a bunch other shit I can't remember.

I was asking around and looking on YouTube for advice on shoes for people with wide feet and people recommended the Nano X2 since they have a wider toe box.  


I have a tall midfoot (don't know if that is the right term. Basically, the top of my foot is tall) and flat feet.

People recommend going half a size down. I'm normally a size 12, so I order a size 11.5, and it feels like a perfect fit save for the tongue.

In this image, you can see the whites of my socks from the sides and the top. I didn't tightly tie the laces in that photo, but even when I pulled the laces tight, it didn't cover up the whites of my socks.  


I'm uncertain if the tongues of the shoe are narrow or if I need to size up.

I got a brace to take pressure off the knee which helps a lot and stops the knee from hurting but it still bothers me.

2068,"I’ve done CrossFit for a long time and i always feel workouts are geared towards a certain body type. If you are bigger framed and can shift more weight you generally favours well in most workouts including the open.

If you are smaller framed generally you gain an advantage in gymnastics because you can move through any bodyweight exercise with ease.

I do not necessarily think this translates 1:1. For example “bigger frames have to move more weight in gymnastics” but naturally they are built with bigger frames so logically they should be able to move more relative to their own weight.

What tends to happen in scaled workouts is that weight gets lighter and difficult gymnastics is removed. So all advantages of a lighter weight athlete are taken away.

Looking to open a discussion on this and maybe I am biased due to my small frame, but when workouts RX are +20-30kg above bodyweight and it gets frustrating 😂.",submissions,crossfit

We have a beginners group and a more advanced one. I started training with the more advanced group at the end of the summer. Began learning how to snatch and after a few months started feeling numbness in my right hand after training sessions. Ignored the feeling and kept going on. The pain got more intense. One night i couldn't even sleep. Went to the doctors and was told i had tendinitis and epicondylitis. The doctor told me to take painkillers and that i can return to training in a week. I did that, but the numbness and pain during sessions didn't go away. Returned to the Docs and was prescribes electrophoresis. The physiologist told me I shouldn't rush to return to crossfit as ligaments heal very slowly.

I feel really angry with myself over this. Like i was starting to make actual progress and this shit happens. Wtf. I don't even understand how long will it heal and for how long should i avoid arm exercises.

2082,"I am a 21 yo 6'1 M 223 lbs, and I am afraid of showing up to my first class.

I don't feel comfortable being myself and **despise** the way I look in the mirror, self love has never been a skill that I practice. I remember seeing a crossfit competition video a long time ago in one of my P.E. classes and being amazed at what the atheletes could do. It was kinda cool. I say this because I was looking around for a new gym to go to so I could ""try"" to live a healthier lifestyle and saw that there is a crossfit gym in my town. I scheduled an appointment with the gym and started their program, they made me do a pre-req course showing me the fundamental/basic movements of crossfit so im not completely braindead when I start my first class. The workouts went *okay,* not without some hiccups, I almost puked and felt exhausted, like concerningly out of shape exhausted. This wasn't my first rodeo doing something physical though, I used to do football back in middle school and took a weightlifting class in high school, alongside previous gym memberships and trainers. After completing it, we agreed that my 3 month membership would start on 11/28/2022, the monday after thanksgiving break since I would be out of town and it would be a waste of money to start it earlier.

I haven't scheduled to go to a class today, and I don't plan on doing one soon. Truth be told, im terrified about it. Its been a week since ive done the pre-req class and ive already forgotten almost all of the forms and workout names. Alongside a week full of nervous binge eating and thanksgiving. I feel horrible and look horrible.

Another major fear is my performance and perception of me in those classes. I'll be in a room full of chisseled athletes, I will stick out like a sore thumb. I felt ashamed doing those pre-req workouts in front of those people while they were doing a class in the background. Genuinely struggling to do squats, and holding a bar properly. I felt like they were silently staring and laughing at me genuinely stuggle to do something so stupidly simple. If it wasn't obvious that I am terribly insecure about myself... then it should be now. I understand that those people are long down the road in their own journeys, and most likely struggled to do the same things I struggled with, but they obviously didn't care where they were or what others thought of them because they continued forging their own path. **But I do**.  I can't even begin to start mine. Im so afraid of being **vunlerable** and **weak** in front of others, that id rather just sit around and do nothing. I figured being around a bunch of go-getters would make me want to go and get some of my own, but I think I just shot myself in the foot.

Right now I am following Marcus Filly's Persist programming and curious to know if I can intertwine it with the conditioning sessions for Iron Man. I have not mapped anything out yet, so if someone has some advice on: 

1) Using the pump or perform track from persist? 

2) How many lifting sessions can I do a week that will be conducive to helping me towards the Iron Man?

3) What should the training split look like?  

4) Is it possible to preserve muscle mass or even gain slightly during this period?

Thank you!",submissions,crossfit
2155,"Hi there community, for a first reddit post ever, I thought why not post what has made really happy past months; Crossfit!

Currently 24 years old, weighing about 72KG

After 5 months of crossfitting currently at:
- Squat 130KG
- Deadlift 140KG
- Snatch 50KG
- Cleans 70KG
-Doing my workouts at about 70% of rx weight. 
- Chest to bar and Toe to bar are now at a decent pace, but much to improve still

Yet to master:
- DU’s
- Bar Muscle Ups
- Handstand walks

Hard to imagine that i couldnt even finish my first 3 workouts when i started.

Any advice to keep progressing?

Any advice you wish someone would have given you when you started?

Hope i will be able to qualify for a competition at some point in the future :)

Just got the orders from the PT: No squats past parallel for 8 weeks. Knee is has tendinitis that needs to calm down and may have strained my Glute medius

Ive been going crossfit for a few months now and Im finding that I wake up exhausted for up to 2 days after most WODs. Its starting to impact my focus, work output and general mood.

I never do heavy lifting, I do boxing and martial arts, and we have this idea coming from our coaches that we should avoid it. They say it's because it will change the way you move your arms for example and if you gain mass it will hinder your movements, and decrease your cardio. Which is partly true.

But, and this is where I come back to the CrossFit. I do a lot of CrossFit , like a lot, because , it allows me to work endurance with some resistance ( kettle bell, rope climbing etc...). I also integrate a lot of Burpees, because my whole body work and heart rates goes high.And I can do them at home.

So usually I begin with series of 20 , and at the end of the training I'm able to do series of 6, 7 max due to the fatigue. Last Thursday for the first time in years I decide to do heavy lifting squats (for a newbie like me 82kg) , from 160 to 200kg.

2246,"I’ve become more convinced that the 9 foundational movements that CF teaches are incorrect IF the goal of CrossFit is provide a service that guides people toward optimal fitness, function, and health. 

The goal (as I understand it) of CrossFit is GPP. Physically preparing individuals for the unknown and unknowable.

Air Squat, Front Squat, Overhead Squat, Strict Press, Push Press, Push Jerk, Deadlift, Sumo Deadlift High Pull, Med Ball Clean.

Being proficient at the above list of movements will make an individual better at the sport of CrossFit. But debatably not better at interacting with the varying demands of their environment. 

This lapse may be a result of the bipolar brand that CrossFit is. A health and fitness service that is also a sport, it’s hard to explain that to newcomers at times. Personally I wish they would rename the CF Games and sell the rights to Rogue and let them run it. 

I believe they miss the simple compound movements such as: Lunge, Horizontal Press, Horizontal Pull, Jumping, and Running. Essential movements for everyday life. 

I’m not here to bash the CF methodologies, however it’s important to further examine how it could be better. I love CrossFit- I have coached for years and previously owned an affiliate.",submissions,crossfit
2247,"Hey y’all! I dabble in CrossFit for circuit training and athletic training. I had a placement at a CrossFit gym years ago and the head trainer there always made the WODs and they were always well rounded and intense. As I’ve been trying to tweak and improve my training lately I’ve been trying to implement more circuit and CrossFit but I’m having trouble coming up with solid rounded challenging workouts.

On the CrossFit site some of the WODs are really short and aren’t targeting all that I wish them to be.. for example a 500m row and 50box jumps for sets in 20 mins , or what have you, isn’t really what I’m looking for.

So I’m just asking is there a way to build personal ones or a good spot to find some solid circuit training regimens. Looking for well rounded conditioning circuits, looking to increase my overall athleticism. Been lifting for years but I want more compound strength, endurance, cardio, speed etc.

2249,"I posted about this on Tuesday in the ""tirade Tuesday"" thread and got a couple negative comments so I'm going to double down on my comments for everyone to see and read. Back story; I've been out of my box the past few weeks for job stuff. Thought I could make a couple class times on the weekend but just never could get back in town on time. Never once received a call, text, or social media message asking where I was at or just checking to see if I was okay. My box probably has roughly 10 coaches and a couple owners and numerous members. 

My thoughts on this is how do you let a customer just disappear for weeks and not even pick up a phone? I've worked in several jobs in customer service and it surprises me how many executives/owners miss big time on retention and service. CrossFit is supposed to be different from Planet Fitness in that our coaches are suppose to care about its members. At least that's what I see from the majority through social media and the friends who attend other boxes. CrossFit coaches are to make sure it's customers are felt wanted and needed at their establishment. It's your job as a coach to help your customers become better individuals through attending your classes. 

And if that's not bad enough, when you return and not one coach says they missed you and glad you're back...BIG RED FLAG. If you're an owner or coach looking to make money or keep your business open, try going the extra mile for your customers. I can't say this enough, customer service is the reason people stay or leave. To be the reason someone leaves and falls back into bad habits and has to start over again. Also don't be the reason someone comes in and turns right around. 

Call me names, tell me I'm an idiot, I really don't care. This is my opinion on what I see and experienced.",submissions,crossfit

Assault Bike = 180.4 Cals, 4.35mi, 68 RPMs Avg, 417 Watts

I'm working with a coach with a great gymnastics background, but I'm the only one in my gym who just can't figure out how to shift weight when upside down so that I can do shoulder taps.

I started in a pretty ugly spot with terrible t-spine/overhead mobility (thanks working at a laptop!). Improving that and putting the time in every day I'm now up to 12 seconds as my best freestanding handstand. 

If I wall walk up and do wall facing then I can still do shoulder taps, though I'm not a hero (can only do maybe 10 before I really hate them, I weight about 200lbs). But if I kick up suddenly I just cannot understand how to shift my weight no matter what I do. I've spent hours beating my head against the problem. 

Every progression I've seen is like ""do wall facing shoulder taps, great! now simply do them facing the other way, wasn't that great too?"" and no. It wasn't great. I could barely get my hand an inch off the ground for more than 0.1 second. I have talked to a lot of others who are stuck at the exact same problem and have no clue... or people who handstand walk fine and say ""no idea, that was always easy for me"".  


Would be amazing if anyone on here can say ""I had the same problem, here is what I did"". But I'm not holding out for miracles.

2368,"I want to preface this by saying I’m using AI very loosely here. We aren’t talking about skynet, but I’m referring to adaptive “individual” programming like perhaps most famously weightlifting.ai, as opposed to generalized programming eg Mayhem, CompTrain etc. 

Personally I’m drawn to the elevator-pitch that it’s more catered to a single person, and I tend to trust data driven processes rather than peoples gut instinct.

On the other hand I cannot shake the feeling that it’s sort of gimmicky. And people tend to feel more unique than they are. Just because it’s “adaptive” doesn’t necessarily make it better. Maybe it’s just a fancy veneer, when it’s better to just stick to what works for center of the bell curve.

2371,"Hello, I've booked my first crossfit taster session for November 16th. I go to a gym four/five days a week already so I'm not new to exercise or lifting weights, but I understand crossfit is really hard and way more demanding. 

I'm 26-years old and only 5ft7 which is really small for a guy, and the most I lift overheard is 20kg (barbells and dumbells) and I've never done exercises like deadlifts before, and on leg days I go light to focus more on lots of reps than weight. I'm quite weak and one of my worries is that things will be way too heavy. Are you allowed to scale down or does every male/female have to do the same weight?

Another worry is that I can do cardio like burpees, box squats, wall balls, and jogging, but I've never done it nonstop and rapid like crossfitters so I'm worried about getting gassed really fast or feeling sick. I have a decent amount of lean muscle and only weigh 154 kg, but I'm definitely not crossfit fit as my stamina whether swimming, jogging, or doing cardio isn't the greatest. 

My final worry is that I suffer from social anxiety. Sorry if this sounds really pathetic, but I'm really awkward around people for the first time and I'm afraid of getting in the way/being too slow and embarrassing myself. Lifting weights and doing cardio at your own pace in a gym is easy as everyone goes about their own business, but I understand crossfit is more community-driven so I am concerned about making a fool of myself. I'm worried I won't be able to do a particular exercise, that a weight will be too heavy, or that I'll quickly burn out. 

I don't really know what to expect from a taster session, so any advice would be really appreciative. I've watched lots of crossfit videos on YouTube to try and get an idea, but I'm still not really sure how much of a crossfit class is cardio exercises (like burpees) compared to weightlifting. I'm also not sure how much you can scale down if something is too heavy or hard.",submissions,crossfit

2382,"Hello everyone, I’ve (24F) been thinking of starting with CrossFit, however there are some concerns that I would like to get opinions on from those who had similar problems.

- I am quite introverted, and I wouldn’t say I’m really that shy, I just can’t imagine being comfortable with exercising in front of a group of people who watch my every move. I used to run, but I would choose places with less people, and also run in the evening when it’s dark already. I’m essentially afraid of doing something wrong and embarrassing myself.

- I’m self-conscious and always wear makeup, because I like it better when I’m not barefaced. I don’t like looking at myself when I’m without makeup, I really have some funky features and I don’t want others to see. Also when I workout I get all red in my face in the worst way possible. Therefore my question is, would it seem weird and awkward if I wore makeup during the sessions? (Not full face, just some foundation, eyebrows and lashes)

- Lastly, do you think the community is welcoming to women, if it is mostly full of men? I’ve checked out some pics and videos of our gym and it was mostly men in their 30s, some women here and there. I am especially afraid that it would be harder to connect with others if we are not the same age.

I’m sorry if these questions seem silly, I am just scared to start something so out of my comfort zone, but I am desperate to do something with my life because I feel like I’m not doing enough for myself and it’s depressing and this seems like something I would be genuinely good at and enjoy in a long run.

2384,"Hi, newbie in my second week of CrossFit. I moved to a place where Barry’s and OrangeTheory aren’t options, there’s either the local Y or a CrossFit box. So I joined CrossFit after a long time of being a fancy studio bootcamp loyalist when it was accessible to me.

I hope this makes sense but the above described studio workouts just feel like “palatable” crossfit? 

I guess studios are less weight-intensive (although weights went up to 60 DB’s). But there were so many times at Barry’s we’d deadlift heavy kettlebells that were comparable in weight to the bars and weights I’m using when starting crossfit. There’s a lot more cardio (even the same dang rowers as OTF). A lot of the pulls and lifts are exactly what I’d do at OTF and Barry’s. Some days the cardio is an outdoor run. It’s just different branding with the option to go heavier? 

It’s so weird like all the OTF/Barry’s girlies (previously myself included) deliberately avoid CrossFit because it’s perceived as more aggressive and can make you bulkier but I feel like they’re two sides of the same token, one is just posh and marketed to be palatable?

Am I entirely off base? I feel like it’s possible to attain the same kind of body that women who do Barry’s or OTF do just by eating clean and hitting your steps while doing CF? Like CF probably won’t make you look like the hulk unless you actively aim for that? All my friends keep saying I’m going to get bulky but all the women at my CF gym seem to be fit, not bulky.

2433,"Good morning.  I like to think I'm a better than average crossfitter.  I have performed every ""standard"" movement at least once; meaning I may not be proficient in everything but I have performed at least a single rep of every standard movement.  

That said, my biggest struggle right now is strict hand push ups.  I am very solid at kipping HSPU and can do repeated sets of 10-15 reps in wods.  I currently can strict press 225 and push press about 275.  Strength wise, I'm probably good into the low 300s on a push jerk but just am not super proficient with the mechanics of the movement yet.  

On to challenges I think I have with strict HSPU.   The first thing that is working against me is my size.  I'm 6'4"" 235 lbs.  I'm not ripped but am relatively lean sitting at 13.9% bodyfat on my latest InBody scan.  At any rate, I know my size is working against me on these.  What inevitably happens to me is my head hits the mat and I go to press but it feels like there is nothing at the bottom of the rep.  I can squeeze out a few reps but the amount of work it requires me to get out of the bottom just wrecks me and they quickly become impossible to do.  If I use some abmats I can rep them out fairly easily so my problem is really in that bottom about 1-2"" of the rep.  How do I overcome that?  My pressing power and endurance are fine but it's almost as if some sort of mechanical disadvantage is killing me when trying to do full ROM strict HSPU.  I'm clearly not on Laura Horvath's level but it feels a lot like that to me in that I'm generally pretty good at everything until these come along.

2438,"Long context, please bear with me. I feel like I should know the answer to this after 10+ years of CF, but I’d like to hear from this community.

I spent most of my CF “career” training 3-4 days per week. I was your average all-around athlete, nothing to write home about.

At the beginning of 2021, I started doing the Wendler 5/3/1 program 5x/week (I added weighted pull-ups as the fifth movement), with very short metcon finishers on upper body days. I did this for a year and a half and started putting up numbers I was really excited about: 555# DL, 445# BS, 335# BP, 235# OHP. My C&amp;J and snatch also improved dramatically, despite minimal technique work.

Start in June of this year, as a challenge to myself, I went back to “normal” CF programming but 7x/week, usually Rx+ on the metcons. (One of those days was usually a longer run or row—basically active recovery.) This got me into the best cardiovascular shape of my life, without losing my strength gains.

That brings me to two weeks ago. For reasons outside my control, I’ve had to return to working out 3-4x/week. On one hand, if I’m being honest, it’s been really nice. I’m less sore, I have more consistent energy throughout the day even on days when I work out, and on WHOOP I’m consistently hitting green recovery scores. On the other hand, I’m worried I’m going to lose the gains I’ve worked so hard for. Is that inevitable? Should I return to 6-7x/week once I can, or is there a way I can program/push myself 3-4x/week such that I can keep progressing, or at least not regress?

Would love to hear any thoughts from the gurus out there.",submissions,crossfit

**1.** **So What is Autophagy?**

Autophagy is when cells in the body begin to break down and recycle parts of cells that no longer function correctly or have been damaged in some way. Each cell is capable of producing a membrane that is able to locate damaged sections of cells, break them down and use them for a variety of purposes. They can be used to create new healthy cells or produce energy that the cells need to function. This natural process is extremely efficient and benefits your body in many big ways.

2. **How to Trigger the Autophagy?**

Naturally Autophagy occurs throughout the body on a regular basis, there are ways to accelerate the process and encourage the body to get rid of unwanted fat cells. The following triggers are very vital in weight loss, but when used to stimulate autophagy, they are extremely effective beyond imagination.

Ø **Exercise** — Exercising put the body under stress and can cause small tears in muscle tissue. These micro-tears aren’t necessarily harmful, but they take a toll on the body and can increase your risk of injury if not given ample time to heal. Autophagy may help clear away these broken and damaged cells associated with the micro-tears and give the body chance to make new cells and regenerate the muscle tissue.

Ø **Fasting** — This is the main trigger of autophagy, like exercise, fasting creates stress on the body. When deprive the body of food for 18hrs to 24hrs the body begin to break down and recycle parts of cells that are dysfunctional or no longer function correctly or have been damaged. Fasting not only helps in weight loss it can help to control chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiac conditions and may help in neurodegenerative diseases by eliminating damaged brain cells. People fast for different reasons like weight loss, spiritual reasons so people can fast for 12 to 18 hours while others prolong the fast for as long as 36 hours to 72hrs.

Ø **Ketosis —** this is process that happens when your body doesn’t have enough carbohydrates to burn for energy and instead it burns fat to produce ketones to use as fuel for the body. Ketosis can make you feel less hungry and decreasing the number of carbohydrates you consume will trigger the autophagy processes. To get into ketosis you may have to fast for 18 hours or longer.",submissions,crossfit

I’m someone who REALLY wants to see him compete solo again.

I happen to have as a client, the most advanced stem cell clinic in North America. 

Asked if they’d consider helping Rich out. 

They said if I could connect them to him, yes.

Stem cells like this usually cost $15,000-$50,000.

So… Free is a very good deal.

What is one thing I can do right Now to support Usblessed?

Eating quickly can lead to weight gain over time, while eating slowly makes you feel more full and boosts weight-reducing hormones, some research has shown that it takes time for the brain to realize that it is no longer hungry so when you consume your food quickly your brain may fail to register how much you have actually eaten and may cause you to eat more than you need.

We eat food and, as it passes through the body, it must be masticated, digested, assimilated and then the waste is eliminated. We have four great organs of elimination, the bowels, the kidneys, the lungs, and the skin.

In order for these eliminative organs to work perfectly, the body must build a high “Vital Force” or energy. It Takes Energy to Eliminate Body Wastes. It takes a tremendous amount of Energy to pass a large meal through the gastro-intestinal tract, the thirty-foot tube that runs from the mouth to the rectum.

It takes the great power of Energy to pass liquids through the 2 million filters of the human kidneys. It takes Energy for the chemical power of the liver and the gall bladder to do their work in preparing food for the billions of body cells to feed upon.

It takes great Energy for the lungs to bring in oxygen to purify the whole 5 to 8 quarts of blood in your body, and expel carbon dioxide.

It takes great Energy for the skin, with its 96 million pores, to throw off body poisons in the form of moisture and sweat. In short, **To lengthen your life, Lessen your meals**. Who is strong? He that can conquer his bad habits.",submissions,crossfit

I've been doing crossfit for quite some time now (almlst 4 years with resting periods), and I'm considering to join Matt's program HWPO60, as I only have 1/1.5h a day to train.
I know it has a suscription model that allows you to keep everything you've paid forever, but here's my question:
I can't train every day, I normally do crossfit 3 days a week, maybe 4, as I like to swim the other days too. I know this program is for 5/6 training days a week.
So, can I pay the first month, for example, and when I'm getting closer to the last day pay the next month?
I don't want  to be overwhelmed about the amount of trainings waiting for me, so this method would work for me! But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Thought you'd get away with it too: Number of days in Spain you could count on two hands, with words of Español on a few fingers. Even the major cities insist on that Madre Tongue.

Friends called you crazy, sent you ""crying-laughing-face"" emojis (and some ""fire"" ones too) when the ""CrossFit Tourism"" bit hit your Instagram story.

An international brand, way of thinking and moving. A familiar methodology. A banner across thousands of doors that says, “We’re just as obsessive as you are”.

“Hola!” quickly followed by a rapid-fire string of Spanish across the gym. No comprende.

You fumble, “Drop-in class, from email?”

“Ah! Changeroom upstairs.”

The previous class is wiping down weights while you decipher the Workout of the Day on the whiteboard. The numbers make sense - times and kilograms - but that’s about it.

Who looks like they know what they’re doing? You plan on copying their every move. If you can keep up. The LCD ticks down to 00:00 and the coach shouts something that must mean ""GO!"".

Soon you’re speaking the universal language of lifting, throwing, catching, jumping, squatting and barely being able to catch a breath. Sweat. ""El sudor"".

2505,"So I moved to a new city and I'm doing a week trial at a new gym... the classes I've been to have been coached by the same guy and here's basically how the 5am class goes: 

People sorta do their own mini-warmup on a bike or erg for a few minutes, but it seems pretty much optional, and then the actual warmup starts. But even then, some people are just talking and choosing to or not to really follow the warmup because the coach just reads off the whiteboard and then starts having conversations with members for the next 5 minutes...Then the strength portion starts and its like the warmup all over again. Coach will say ""work up to a heavy set of 3 front squats over 5 sets"" or whatever the workout is, then go from member to member and not really coach them, but just strike up conversation and make jokes. Meanwhile, some people in the room are finishing their sets in 5 minutes and talk the rest of the time, some people are focused and do structured sets every two minutes, and one day someone on the side of the room even did a couple of sets and just started the metcon before the strength portion was even over... There's no structure at all and I honestly can't think of a time in the past week that I've heard the coach actually correct anyone's (mine included) form.

And this is a polar opposite experience from what I've seen in the 4 years up to this point... I got really lucky where I used to live because the two gyms closest to me were run by former or current individual games athletes that took coaching and their classes very seriously. Like as soon as the class started, everyone was quiet and paying attention, the coach was coaching everyone during the warmup, critiquing and correcting everyone's movements during the strength portion of the workout, then giving encouragement and constructive guidance during the metcons. Everyone took the hour very seriously and the coaching made me feel like I was getting a steal on the membership price, even knowing how expensive Crossfit gyms can be.

But with this new gym, I can't help but feel like I'm about to get robbed if I decide to pay over $200 a month for what feels like access to bumper plates via a guy that gets paid to unlock the gym doors and drink coffee... So, I guess what I'm asking is do I have a skewed perspective from how lucky I got with previous coaches and this guy is the norm? Is this how a lot of Crossfit gyms are?
